## How to run

` pip install terminal-karaoke `
` terminal-karaoke ` OR ` python -m terminal_karaoke `

(preferably run it when you're in the directory where the library folder is)

## Music files
Your songs (.mp3) and lyrics (.lrc) are to be stored in the ./library/ folder. They're by default downloaded there. 
They should have the same name for the program to recognize.
