## VS Code & Copilot Integration Tips

To get the most out of flowscribe with Copilot and VS Code:

- Enable Copilot Chat’s workspace access and relevant tools (search, codebase, changes, problems).
- Keep artifacts in `./.autodev/` so they’re easy to find.
- Use consistent flow names so Copilot can locate code by name.
- Start with `.autodev/ask.md` for Copilot prompts, then `.autodev/summary.md`, then tail `.autodev/trace.jsonl`.
- Use the flow catalog (`flows.yaml`) to map flows to code and document intent.
- For best results, pin `.autodev/copilot_init.md` open in VS Code and paste it into Copilot Chat when you start a session.

-- Add more integration tips as your workflow evolves.

## TL;DR

* 🧭 **Flow-first:** You name flows (e.g., `data/fetch/minute_candles`, `orders/submit`) and steps.
* ✅ **Explicit intent:** You decide what counts as *success* or *failure* (not just “no exception”).
* 📜 **Structured events:** Checkpoints, successes, failures, exceptions, metrics — each with file/line/tags/evidence.
* 📂 **Pluggable outputs:** Console (human), JSONL (AI/tools), SQLite (optional) — summarized into Markdown.
* 🤝 **Copilot integration:** End-of-run **summary** and **ask-prompt** files so Copilot can explain failures and propose fixes/tests.
* 🔒 **Safe by design:** Redacts secrets, caps payload sizes, fails safe (never crashes your app).

---

## Why (Motivation)

Debugging complex systems often devolves into print spam, log-diving, or stepping through code that doesn’t reflect real production flows. **flowscribe** replaces that chaos with a small number of **intentional markers** that tell a truthful story of what happened — and packages the story into **human-readable** and **AI-ready** artifacts.

---

## Design Principles

* **Fail-safe:** Tracing must never take down your app.
* **Lightweight:** Minimal overhead and dependencies.
* **Intent over noise:** A few high-signal markers beat verbose logs.
* **Human + machine:** Console summarizes for humans; JSONL is for tools/AI.
* **Privacy-first:** Redact sensitive data; keep traces local by default.

---

## Mental Model & Glossary

* **Session:** One program run (unique run_id + metadata like mode/tags).
* **Flow:** Named unit of work (e.g., `indicators/ema/compute`).
* **Step:** Sub-action inside a flow (e.g., `validate`, `fetch`, `compute`).
* **Event:** A fact about a step/flow (`checkpoint`, `success`, `failure`, `exception`, `metric`, `summary`).
* **Link:** Relationships across flows/threads/processes (parent/child, caused_by, correlation keys).
* **Tags:** Free-form labels for slicing (e.g., `AAPL`, `phase5`, `sim`).

---

## How It Works (Runtime Behavior)

1. **Start a session** (app name, run mode, tags, git SHA recorded).
2. **User-placed markers** record the path taken: checkpoints, successes, failures, exceptions, metrics.
3. **Context is automatic**: file path, line number, function, thread; optional evidence (counts, shapes, IDs, hashes).
4. **Sinks persist** the timeline (Console, JSONL; SQLite optional).
5. **End-of-run artifacts** are written:

   * `./.autodev/summary.md` — narrative overview
   * `./.autodev/ask.md` — Copilot-ready prompt
   * `./.autodev/trace.jsonl` — full machine-readable timeline

> Artifacts can be written per-run at `./.autodev/runs/<run_id>/` with `./.autodev/latest` pointing to the most recent.

---

## Flow‑First Tracing (Naming & Linking)

### Naming

* Use path-like identifiers: `domain/subdomain/action`.
* Keep verbs last so related flows sort together.
* Be consistent (snake_case or kebab-case).

### Linking

* **Hierarchy:** `parent` gives parent/child trees (e.g., `premarket` → `data/fetch` → `indicators/compute`).
* **Correlation keys:** Join work across threads/processes (e.g., `ticker`, `date`, `request_id`).
* **Causal links:** Use `caused_by` to connect an event that triggered another flow.

### Success / Failure Semantics

* **Success** = business expectation met (e.g., non-empty candles; indicators present; order acknowledged).
* **Failure** = unmet expectation even if no exception (e.g., empty dataset, missing column, threshold missed).
* **Exception** = system error (tracked independently; a failure may wrap an exception for context).

### Event Taxonomy

* `checkpoint` — reached a notable point.
* `success` — intent met (with short reason/evidence).
* `failure` — intent not met (with class & reason; severities: warn|error|critical).
* `exception` — unhandled/system error.
* `metric` — scalar value (latency, counts, sizes).
* `summary` — end-of-flow/session roll-up.

### Data Attachment Policy

* Prefer **counts, shapes, ranges, IDs, hashes** over raw payloads.
* Redact keys: `api_key`, `token`, `password`, `secret`, `auth`, `cookie` (extendable).
* Truncate large evidence with `… (truncated)` and note limits.

### Error Classes (for triage)

* **SYSTEM:** exceptions, timeouts, resource exhaustion.
* **DATA:** empty/malformed/late inputs.
* **CONTRACT:** invalid state or failed validation.
* **EXTERNAL:** upstream/downstream service failures.
* **BUSINESS:** domain rule not satisfied.

---

## End‑of‑Run Artifacts

**Always written (or on failure, based on config):**

* **`summary.md`** — flows started/ended, first & most-recent failures, latency outliers, orphaned flows.
* **`ask.md`** — Copilot-ready prompt with run header, flow sketch, top issues, safe evidence, and a compact trace excerpt.
* **`trace.jsonl`** — append-only event stream (one JSON object per line).

**Prompt contents (ask.md):**

* Goal → *diagnose first failure(s), propose minimal patch, add a test*.
* Run header → run_id, mode, tags.
* Flow graph sketch → successes, failures, skipped/orphaned.
* Top issues → first+latest failures with class and file:line.
* Evidence → small facts (counts, shapes, ranges, IDs, hashes).
* Trace excerpt → last N events (size-capped).
* Action request → specific asks for Copilot (where to look, what to produce).

**Guardrails:** redaction, truncation, selective excerpts, deterministic names.

## Configuration — `./.autodev/ra.yaml`

Control what is recorded, where it is written, and how artifacts are produced.

**Goals**: quick on/off, selective flows/tags, sinks & artifacts, privacy, performance.

## Flow Catalog — `./.autodev/flows.yaml`

Declare flows once, toggle them centrally, and document success criteria & code references. The library reads this file to validate events, enrich summaries, and guide Copilot.

```yaml
version: 1
defaults:
  tags: ["phase5"]
  correlation_keys: ["ticker", "date"]
  on_failure: generate_prompt

flows:
  - id: "premarket/prepare"
    enabled: true
    description: "Validate market day, configs, and data sources."
    success:
      criteria:
        - "market_day = true"
        - "configs_loaded = true"
    failure_classes: ["BUSINESS.MARKET_CLOSED", "SYSTEM.CONFIG_MISSING"]
    code_refs:
      - "src/lifecycle/premarket_context.py"
    tags: ["mode", "phase"]

  - id: "data/fetch/minute_candles"
    enabled: true
    description: "Fetch minute candles for the active ticker and date."
    parent: "premarket/prepare"
    success:
      criteria:
        - "rows >= 300"
        - "time_range covers [09:30,16:00]"
    failure_classes: ["DATA.EMPTY", "EXTERNAL.4xx", "EXTERNAL.5xx", "CONTRACT.VALIDATION"]
    correlation_keys: ["ticker", "date", "source"]
    code_refs:
      - "src/data/fetcher.py"
    tags: ["ticker", "mode"]

  - id: "indicators/ema/compute"
    enabled: true
    description: "Compute indicator columns required by agents."
    parent: "data/fetch/minute_candles"
    success:
      criteria:
        - "columns include: ema_9, ema_21, rsi"
    failure_classes: ["CONTRACT.VALIDATION", "DATA.MISSING_COLUMN"]
    code_refs:
      - "features/indicator_utils.py"
    tags: ["ticker", "mode"]

  - id: "agent/decision/evaluate"
    enabled: true
    description: "Produce an action with a confidence score."
    success:
      criteria:
        - "action in {buy, sell, hold}"
        - "score >= threshold"
    failure_classes: ["BUSINESS.NO_ACTION", "DATA.BAD_STATE"]
    code_refs:
      - "src/agent/decision.py"
    tags: ["ticker", "mode"]

  - id: "orders/submit"
    enabled: true
    description: "Submit order to broker and await ack."
    parent: "agent/decision/evaluate"
    success:
      criteria:
        - "ack received with order_id"
    failure_classes: ["EXTERNAL.TIMEOUT", "EXTERNAL.REJECTED"]
    sla:
      p95_ms: 1000
    code_refs:
      - "src/orders/broker_x.py"
    tags: ["ticker", "mode"]
```

**Notes**

* `id` is canonical; do not repurpose names.
* `enabled` toggles tracing for that flow without touching code.
* `parent` forms the hierarchy; `correlation_keys` link across concurrency/process boundaries.
* `success.criteria` and `failure_classes` document intent; `code_refs` guide humans/Copilot.
* `sla` (optional) is used in performance summaries.

## Copilot Init Prompt — `./.autodev/copilot_init.md`

Paste this file into your repo so Copilot understands how to help on this project.

**Purpose**: Tell Copilot what artifacts to read first, how flows map to code, and what outputs to produce.

```
# Copilot Init Prompt — flowscribe (flow-first runtime analyzer)

You are assisting on a project that uses a flow-first runtime analyzer.

## What to know
- We name flows/steps (e.g., data/fetch/minute_candles, orders/submit).
- Events: checkpoint, success, failure, exception, metric, summary.
- Each event has context (file/line/func/tags) and small evidence (counts/shapes/ranges/ids/hashes).

## Files to open first
- ./.autodev/ask.md      # Copilot-ready prompt for the last run
- ./.autodev/summary.md  # Human summary of flows & outcomes
- ./.autodev/trace.jsonl # Full timeline (JSONL)
- Optionally: ./.autodev/runs/<run_id>/* for a specific run

## How to work
1) Start with ask.md → then summary.md → then tail trace.jsonl (last 50–200 events).
2) Map flow names to code using workspace search.
3) Focus on the first failure per flow, and the most recent failure.
4) Propose minimal patches and a test; keep flow markers/intent intact.
5) Use evidence as ground truth; don’t request secrets.

## Your outputs
- Root cause summary (3–6 bullets) referencing flow names and file:line.
- Minimal patch plan (files/functions; rationale).
- Test plan (what it verifies; setup; assertions).
- Risk checklist (side effects, perf, follow-ups).
- Next commands/tasks to run locally.
```

> Tip: Pin this file open in VS Code and paste it into Copilot Chat when you start a session.

---

## VS Code & Copilot Integration (No-Code Setup)

* Enable Copilot Chat’s **workspace access** and relevant tools (search, codebase, changes, problems).
* Keep artifacts in `./.autodev/` so they’re easy to find.
* Use consistent flow names so Copilot can locate code by name.

---

## Adoption Checklists

**Team (what to decide)**

* Identify 6–10 critical flows.
* Agree on success criteria, likely failure classes, and tags.
* Decide correlation keys (e.g., `ticker`, `date`).
* Confirm redaction list and evidence size caps.
* Choose which domains are summarized (e.g., `data/*`, `orders/*`).

**Project hygiene**

* Every started flow ends with a verdict (success/failure).
* Minimal, safe evidence (counts/shapes/IDs/hashes; no raw payloads).
* Stable naming; avoid repurposing flow IDs.

**Config hygiene**

* Reasonable defaults in `ra.yaml` (profile=critical, ask.md on failure).
* Rotation/retention set to avoid unbounded growth.
* Env overrides documented for quick experiments.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **No artifacts?** Check `enabled: true`, profile filters, and sink/artifact toggles.
* **Too much noise?** Narrow `include_flows`/`include_tags`, raise `min_severity`.
* **Sensitive data concerns?** Extend `redact_keys`; keep `allow_raw_payloads: false`.
* **Trace too large?** Lower `payload_limit`, `trace_tail_events`, enable rotation.
* **Hard to find code?** Add/refresh `code_refs` in `flows.yaml` to guide search.

---

## Security & Privacy

* Traces are **local by default**; nothing leaves your machine unless you configure it.
* Redaction is on by default for common keys; extend for your domain.
* Evidence is intentionally small; payloads are truncated with clear markers.

---

## Performance Expectations

* Events are tiny and buffered.
* Overhead is designed to be minimal; prefer marking **flow boundaries** and **decision points** over every line.

---

## Use Cases

* Complex pipelines (data/ML) needing ground-truth runtime paths.
* Web/CLI apps where logs don’t capture **intent**.
* AI-assisted debugging (Copilot/ChatGPT) that benefits from structured evidence.
* Onboarding: show newcomers the path the code actually took.

---

## Planned Features & Ideas (Roadmap)

**Developer Features**

* Searchable timeline CLI; session diffing; auto-test recorder; context snapshots.

**Copilot & AI**

* Auto prompt file on failure; explain mode; root-cause ranking.

**Observability & Viz**

* Metrics aggregation (success/failure ratios; latency histograms/p95); timeline exports (Chrome trace/Mermaid); built-in SQLite reports.

**Safety & Robustness**

* Redaction presets; payload hashing; strong async/multiprocess support.

**Quality of Life**

* Flow templates; framework adapters (pytest, FastAPI, CLI); quick toggle via env.

**Stretch**

* Replay mode; Copilot auto-loop; multi-language SDKs; pluggable sinks (S3/Kafka/Elastic/Prometheus); terminal TUI.
