# core/formatter.py
"""
Improved formatter utilities for CodeScribe AI.

Features:
- truncate long file summaries safely (doesn't chop inside fenced code blocks)
- optional HTML <details> folding (useful for preview pages)
- option to truncate by lines or by characters
- closes unclosed code fences after truncation

    """
    Truncate/collapse long file summaries safely.

    Args:
        summary_dict: mapping file path -> summary string.
        max_lines: primary limit in lines (if longer, will try to cut safely).
        max_chars: optional absolute character cap per summary (applied after line truncation).
        use_html: if True, wrap full summary inside an HTML <details> block and show a short preview;
                  if False, append a short truncation note.
        fallback_truncate_text: text to append when not using HTML.

    Returns:
        dict: updated mapping file path -> (possibly collapsed) markdown string.

    Notes:
    - This function tries NOT to split fenced code blocks (```), and will close an unclosed fence if needed.
    - Called by run_pipeline.py after collecting file summaries (so that README previews stay compact).
