### Technical Specifications

- **Minimum Python Version**: 3.8
- **Dependencies**: Zero runtime dependencies (development dependencies for testing/linting only)
- **Performance**: Optimized for low-latency logging with minimal overhead
- **Thread Safety**: Safe for multi-threaded applications
- **Memory Efficient**: Designed for minimal memory footprint

### Installation

```bash
# From PyPI
pip install logflux-io

# With pre-release flag for beta versions  
pip install --pre logflux-io

# Development installation
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Quick Start

#### Basic Usage
```python
import logflux

# Create a Unix socket client
client = logflux.new_unix_client()

# Send a log entry
entry = logflux.new_log_entry(
    message="Hello from LogFlux Python SDK!",
    level=logflux.LEVEL_INFO
)
client.log(entry)
```

#### Batch Processing
```python
import logflux

# Create a batch client for high-throughput logging
batch_client = logflux.new_batch_unix_client()

# Log multiple entries efficiently
for i in range(1000):
    entry = logflux.new_log_entry(
        message=f"Batch log entry {i}",
        level=logflux.LEVEL_INFO
    )
    batch_client.log(entry)

# Ensure all logs are sent
batch_client.flush()
```

#### Python Logging Integration
```python
import logging
from logflux.integrations.logging_handler import LogFluxHandler

# Set up Python logging with LogFlux
handler = LogFluxHandler()
logging.basicConfig(handlers=[handler], level=logging.INFO)

# Use standard Python logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("This log will be sent to LogFlux agent")
```
