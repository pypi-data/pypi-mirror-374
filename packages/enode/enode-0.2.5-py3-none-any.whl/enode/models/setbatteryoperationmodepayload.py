    * `SELF_RELIANCE`: Minimizes household reliance on the grid. Prioritizes using own energy from solar or battery for household consumption before importing from grid. Energy may be exported to the grid from solar, depending on excess solar and your user's settings in the OEM app.
    * `TIME_OF_USE`: Maximizes energy cost savings in accordance with a user-defined schedule matching a utility rate plan. Energy may be consumed from solar, battery, or grid sources, depending on the current prices and your user's settings in the OEM app. Energy may be exported to the grid from solar or battery sources, depending on current prices and your user's settings in the OEM app.
    * `IMPORT_FOCUS`: Prioritizes charging the battery. Uses excess solar energy for charging and will charge from grid if possible. Leveraged energy sources depend on the configuration of the battery. Note: Focus modes target a certain battery behavior but are ultimately internal to the battery. Actual behavior might differ from the focus mode.
    * `EXPORT_FOCUS`: Prioritizes discharging energy stored in the battery back to the household and any excess to the grid. Grid exports often depend on local regulation and might require agreements with grid providers to be supported.  Note: Focus modes target a certain battery behavior but are ultimately internal to the battery. Actual behavior might differ from the focus mode.
