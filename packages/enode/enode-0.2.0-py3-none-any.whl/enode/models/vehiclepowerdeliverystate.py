    r"""The current state of power delivery between the vehicle and charger.

    * `UNKNOWN`: The state of power delivery is currently unknown.
    * `UNPLUGGED`: The vehicle is not connected to the charger.
    * `PLUGGED_IN:INITIALIZING`: The charging station is preparing to deliver power to the vehicle. It is expected for this state to shortly transition into PLUGGED_IN:CHARGING.
    * `PLUGGED_IN:CHARGING`: The vehicle is actively receiving power from the charger, causing the battery level to increase.
    * `PLUGGED_IN:COMPLETE`: The charging process has finished and the vehicle's battery has reached the target charge limit.
    * `PLUGGED_IN:STOPPED`: The charging process has been intentionally stopped by either the vehicle or the charger. The vehicle is still plugged in and waiting for the charging process to resume.
    * `PLUGGED_IN:NO_POWER`: The vehicle attempted to initialize charging, however no external power was available. It is not possible to transition into a charging state with a remote command until there is some user intervention to resolve the issue.
    * `PLUGGED_IN:FAULT`: A malfunction in the charging process is preventing power from being delivered. Possible causes include a charging cable not being properly locked, extreme temperatures, or malfunctions in either the charging station or the vehicle's internal system. It is not possible to transition into a charging state with a remote command until there is some user intervention to resolve the issue.
    * `PLUGGED_IN:DISCHARGING`: The vehicle is actively discharging by giving power to the home/grid, causing the battery level to decrease.
