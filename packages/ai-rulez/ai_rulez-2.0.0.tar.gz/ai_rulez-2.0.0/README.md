**One config to rule them all.**

Tired of manually managing rule files, subagents, and custom commands across different AI tools? `ai-rulez` gives you one `ai-rulez.yml` file to generate them all. Keep your AI context in sync, and even launch MCP servers for direct integration.

## Feature Highlights

`ai-rulez` is a progressive tool-box, designed to offer a centralized way to manage AI tooling for a repository.

### Centralized Configuration
- **Centralized Definitions:** Use a single `ai-rulez.yml` as the source of truth to define rules, file structures, and documentation for all your AI tools.
- **Nested Configs & Monorepo Support:** Scale your configurations with `extends` and `includes`. Manage complex projects and monorepos with ease by using the `--recursive` flag to combine configurations from multiple files.
  ```bash
  # Generate rules for all projects in a monorepo
  ai-rulez generate --recursive
  ```

### Powerful Tooling
- **Custom Commands:** Define custom commands that your AI assistant can execute, enabling powerful, interactive workflows.
- **Specialized AI Agents:** Create specialized "sub-agents" with their own system prompts and tools, perfect for complex tasks like code reviews or database queries.
- **MCP Servers:** Launch a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to allow AI assistants to programmatically interact with your configuration.
- **Full-Featured CLI:** Manage your entire configuration from the command line. Add rules, update agents, and generate files without ever opening a YAML file.

### Flexible Integrations
- **Multi-Tool Support:** Use presets to instantly generate configurations for popular AI tools like Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, and more.
- **Custom Tool Integration:** Don't see your favorite tool on the list? Use the `outputs` key to generate a configuration file for any tool, in any format.

## How It Works

`ai-rulez` takes your `ai-rulez.yml` file and uses it as a single source of truth to generate native configuration files for all your AI tools. Think of it as a build system for AI contextâ€”you write the source once, and it compiles to whatever format each tool needs.

## Example: `ai-rulez.yml`

```yaml
$schema: https://github.com/Goldziher/ai-rulez/schema/ai-rules-v2.schema.json

metadata:
  name: "My SaaS Platform"
  version: "2.0.0"

# Use presets for common configurations
presets:
  - "popular"  # Includes Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and Copilot

rules:
  - name: "Go Code Standards"
    priority: high
    content: "Follow standard Go project layout (cmd/, internal/, pkg/). Use meaningful package names and export only what is necessary."

sections:
  - name: "Project Structure"
    priority: critical
    content: |
      - `cmd/`: Main application entry point
      - `internal/`: Private application code (business logic, data access)
      - `pkg/`: Public-facing libraries

agents:
  - name: "go-developer"
    description: "Go language expert for core development"
    system_prompt: "You are an expert Go developer. Your key responsibilities include writing idiomatic Go, using proper error handling, and creating comprehensive tests."
```

Run `ai-rulez generate` â†’ get all your configuration files, perfectly synchronized.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize your project with a preset (recommended)
ai-rulez init "My Project" --preset popular

# 2. Add your project-specific context
ai-rulez add rule "Tech Stack" --priority critical --content "This project uses Go and PostgreSQL."

# 3. Generate all AI instruction files
ai-rulez generate
```

## Installation

### Run without installing

For one-off executions, you can run `ai-rulez` directly without a system-wide installation.

**Go**
```bash
go run github.com/Goldziher/ai-rulez/cmd/ai-rulez@latest --help
```

**Node.js (via npx)**
```bash
# Installs and runs the latest version
npx ai-rulez@latest init
```

**Python (via uvx)**
```bash
# Runs ai-rulez in a temporary virtual environment
uvx ai-rulez init
```

### Install globally

For frequent use, a global installation is recommended.

**Go**
```bash
go install github.com/Goldziher/ai-rulez/cmd/ai-rulez@latest
```

**Homebrew (macOS/Linux)**
```bash
brew install goldziher/tap/ai-rulez
```

**npm**
```bash
npm install -g ai-rulez
```

**pip**
```bash
pip install ai-rulez
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

You can use `ai-rulez` with `pre-commit` to automatically validate and generate your AI configuration files.

Add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Goldziher/ai-rulez
    rev: v2.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: ai-rulez-validate
      - id: ai-rulez-generate
```
