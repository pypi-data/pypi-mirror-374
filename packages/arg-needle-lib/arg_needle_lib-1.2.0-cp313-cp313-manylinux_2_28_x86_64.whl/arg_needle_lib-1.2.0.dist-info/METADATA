# arg-needle-lib

This repository contains arg-needle-lib, which implements an ARG data structure and ARG-based analyses such as genealogy-wide association.

## Quickstart

### Install the Python module from PyPI

Most functionality is available through a Python module which can be installed with:

```bash
pip install arg-needle-lib
```

This Python module is currently available on Linux and macOS.

### Documentation

Please see the [ARG-Needle manual](https://palamaralab.github.io/software/argneedle/) for all usage instructions and documentation.

## License

# arg-needle-lib Release Notes

## v1.2.0 (2025-09-04)

### Other changes

- Add option to provide height value in `add_sample`. If omitted the height is set to 0 so original code behaves as normal.
- Fixed `compute_grm` alpha argument default value from 0 to -1, as stated in the function's API docs.

## v1.1.3 (2025-02-24)

### Other changes

- Resolve incompatibility preventing wheels being built for Python 3.13
- Additionally, build wheels for Linux arm64. Can now `pip install arg-needle-lib` in Docker on arm64 Macbook, for example.

## v1.1.2 (2025-02-21)

### Other changes

- Added `get_midpoint_height` method to Mutation API, to calculate a height (age) estimate using the midpoint of the containing edge
- Build wheels for Python 3.13

## v1.1.1 (2024-10-21)

### Other changes

- Added `child_edges_at` method to ARGNode API, for parity for existing methods like `parent_edge_at`

## v1.1.0 (2024-09-26)

### Major changes

- Added methods for genotype mapping
  - map_genotype_to_ARG, taking a single genotype as a vector/list and a position
  - map_genotypes_to_ARG, taking a matrix of genotypes, and a vector/list of positions
- Method to get sorted vector/list of positions from ARG object is renamed to get_site_positions from get_sites 

### Other changes

- Improve documentation
- Deserialization now performed in C++ rather than Python
- Python infrastructure modernized to replace setup.py with pyproject.toml


## v1.0.2 (2023-09-29)

### Breaking changes

None

### Other changes

- Improve documentation.
- Build Python wheels for macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- Build wheels for Python 3.12


## v1.0.1 (2023-07-14)

### Breaking changes

None

### Other changes

- Clean-up and release of the source code.
- Improved mutation class.
- Added from-to parameters to some functions.


## v1.0.0 (2023-03-07)

Initial PyPI release of arg-needle-lib.
