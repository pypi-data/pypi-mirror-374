"""Decorators module for Peak SDK.

This module provides decorator-based caching functionality with support for:
- InMemoryCache: Thread-safe in-memory cache with TTL support
- PlatformCacheRepository: Unified cache repository with platform cache and fallback
- Cache decorator: Function decorator for automatic result caching with Cache-Control support
- Cache invalidation: Decorator and utilities for cache invalidation after write operations
- Cache utilities: Helper functions for cache key generation, result processing, and Cache-Control parsing
- Cache exceptions: Custom exceptions for cache-related errors

The cache system supports both platform cache (when available) and in-memory fallback.

Optional Dependencies:
- numpy: For serializing numpy arrays (installed with: pip install peak-sdk[types])
- pandas: For serializing pandas DataFrames and Series (installed with: pip install peak-sdk[types])
- starlette: For handling Starlette Response objects (installed with: pip install peak-sdk[types])

These dependencies are optional and the cache decorator will work without them, but with limited
serialization support for these specific data types.
