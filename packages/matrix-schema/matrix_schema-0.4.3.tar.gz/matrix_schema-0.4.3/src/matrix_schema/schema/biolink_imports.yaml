      knowledge_assertion:
        text: knowledge_assertion
        description: A statement of purported fact that is put forth by an agent as
          true, based on assessment of direct evidence. Assertions are likely but
          not  definitively true.
        notes:
        - Knowledge Assertions are supported by direct evidence deemed sufficient
          by some agent to support a confidence assertion of truth. Our certainty  in
          this truth is not absolute, but is typically higher than for Predictions.
        aliases:
        - assertion
      logical_entailment:
        text: logical_entailment
        description: A statement reporting a conclusion that follows logically from
          premises representing established facts or knowledge assertions (e.g. fingernail
          part of finger, finger part of hand --> fingernail part of hand).
        notes:
        - These statements report entailed conclusions derived through dedictive inference.
          They are not directly asserted by a source, but logically follow from statement(s)  a
          source does make - and are necessarily true if their supporting premises
          are true.  In practice, these will primarily be entailments based on logic
          encoded in ontologies.  Examples include propagation of annotated knowledge
          to hierarchically-related concepts, across paths through a graph constructed
          from transitive relationships, or sets of  relationships that support property
          chain inference.
        aliases:
        - deductive_inference
      prediction:
        text: prediction
        description: A statement of a possible fact based on probabilistic forms of
          reasoning over more indirect forms of evidence, that lead to more speculative
          conclusions.
        notes:
        - Predictions typically result from non-deductive forms of reasoning - e.g.
          inductive and deductive inference, or statistical inference where conclusions
          are drawn about a broader/global population based on data from a representative
          cohort. For example, a prediction that a drug may treat a particular disease
          based on its chemical similarity to known drugs that treat the disease,
          and the fact that it can inhibit proteins  in a pathway that is associated
          with the disease As Predictions are based on weaker forms of inference and
          evidence, they are typically  considered lower confidence statements as
          compared to Knowledge Assertions and Logical Entailments.
        aliases:
        - hypothesis
      statistical_association:
        text: statistical_association
        description: A statement that reports concepts representing variables in a
          dataset to be statistically associated with each other in a particular cohort
          (e.g. 'Metformin Treatment (variable 1) is correlated with Diabetes Diagnosis
          (variable 2) in EHR dataset X').
        notes:
        - Such statements report the direct results of some statistical analysis.
          Their scope is limited tp the cohort/dataset interrogated in the analysis,
          and they do not make broader claims or draw  more meaningful conclusions
          about the domain of discourse. Note however that such Statistical  Associations
          can be used as evidence to support a more pointed/precise Prediction or
          Assertion  of knowledge. For example, e.g. a Statistical Association between
          'Metformin Prescription' and 'Diabetes Diagnosis' in EHR records could support
          a Prediction that 'Metformin treats Diabetes',  or 'Metformin causes Diabetes'.
          This 'treats' edge may have a knowledge_level of 'Prediction',  but the
          provider could use the 'evidence_type' edge property to indicate that this
          prediction is  based on a 'Statistical Association'. Because Statistical
          Associations directly report analysis-specific  results, we can consider
          them to be inherently true statements, whose broader utility is dependent
          on  subsequent generalization of the reported result to a broader population,
          and/or interpretation of the  result as support for a more meaningful statements
          about the domain of discourse.
      observation:
        text: observation
        description: A statement reporting (and possibly quantifying) a phenomenon
          that was observed to occur -  absent any analysis or interpretation that
          generates a statistical association or supports a broader conclusion or
          inference.
        notes:
        - An observation that "56362 people self-reported taking melatonin to treat
          migraines" is agnostic to whether melatonin is an effective or approved
          treatment - it only claims that it was taken for this purpose. Such observations,
          however, may be used as the basis for predicting that a  drug may be efficacious
          against a disease.
      not_provided:
        text: not_provided
        description: The knowledge level is not provided, typically because it cannot
          be determined from available. information.
        notes:
        - This term is most often applied for text-mined edges, as NLP tools are typically
          not able to detect a specific knowledge level for the concept relationships
          they extract (e.g. whether the author  was predicting or asserting a relationship,
          or merely observed it to occur).

      manual_agent:
        text: manual_agent
        description: A human agent who is responsible for generating a statement of
          knowledge. The human may utilize computationally generated information as
          evidence for the resulting knowledge,  but the human is the one who ultimately
          interprets/reasons with  this evidence to produce a statement of knowledge.
      automated_agent:
        text: automated_agent
        description: An automated agent, typically a software program or tool, that
          is  responsible for generating a statement of knowledge. Human contribution  to
          the knowledge creation process ends with the definition and coding of algorithms
          or analysis pipelines that get executed by the automated agent.
      data_analysis_pipeline:
        text: data_analysis_pipeline
        description: An automated agent that executes an analysis workflow over data
          and  reports the direct results of the analysis. These typically report  statistical
          associations/correlations between variables in the input dataset, and do
          not interpret/infer broader conclusions from associations the analysis reveals
          in the data.
        is_a: automated_agent
        notes:
        - If an analysis pipeline includes any rules for generating broader  conclusions
          based on the dataset-specific statistical correlations it calculates (e.g.
          create a 'treats' edge when the analysis reveals a  drug-disease correlation
          in the data with statistical scores that meet a  certain threshold) - we
          would consider this agent to be a Computational Model rather than just a
          Data Analysis Pipeline.
      computational_model:
        text: computational_model
        description: An automated agent that generates knowledge statements (typically
          predictions) based on rules/logic explicitly encoded in an algorithm (e.g.
          heuristic models, supervised classifiers), or learned from patterns  observed
          in data (e.g. ML models, unsupervised classifiers).
        is_a: automated_agent
        notes:
        - The bar is quite low relatively for what is considered to be a  ‘computational
          model’ by our definition. Even agents/tools that apply  simple rules or
          logic to the output of an ingest or analysis pipeline to allow for a stronger
          or more general conclusion to be stated can  qualify an agent as a model.
          For example, an ingest pipeline that applies rules to its ingest of  clinical
          trials data to create a 'treats' prediction edge when the  source reports
          a drug to be in phase 2 or 3 trials represents a computational model because
          it is automatically drawing a stronger conclusion than the source reports,
          based on logic encoded in the ingest pipeline. Similarly, a data analysis
          pipeline that is extended with rules to  automatically generate broader
          conclusions based on dataset-specific statistical correlations (e.g. create
          a 'treats' edge when the analysis reveals a drug-disease correlation in
          the data with statistical scores  that meet a certain threshold), would
          also qualify as a computational  model by our definition.
      text_mining_agent:
        text: text_mining_agent
        description: An automated agent that uses Natural Language Processing to recognize
          concepts and/or relationships in text, and report them using formally encoded
          semantics (e.g. as an edge in a knowledge graph).
        is_a: automated_agent
        notes:
        - The original statement in the source text is typically made by a human /  manual
          agent, but if a specific encoding of this knowledge is produced by a text-mining
          tool, it has an agent_type of 'text_mining_agent'. Examples of text mining
          agents include SemmedDB, and the Translator Text-Mining Knowledge Provider.
          Note that text-mining tools are prone to erroneous interpretation of  concepts
          and relationships, and can fail to provide important details  about the
          context in which the original knowledge was reported - so users should always
          consult the source text for a text-mined statement to assess its veracity
          and relevance.
      image_processing_agent:
        text: image_processing_agent
        description: An automated agent that processes images to generate textual
          statements of  knowledge derived from the image and/or expressed in text
          the image  depicts (e.g. via OCR).
        is_a: automated_agent
      manual_validation_of_automated_agent:
        text: manual_validation_of_automated_agent
        description: A human agent reviews and validates/approves the veracity of
          knowledge  that is initially generated by an automated agent.
        notes:
        - This term applies when a human was only involved in evaluating the veracity
          of a knowledge statement that was generated by an automated agent. It is  important
          to indicate when such manual review has occurred, because it can give a
          user more confidence in an automated statement.
      not_provided:
        text: not_provided
        description: The agent type is not provided, typically because it cannot be
          determined from available information if the agent that generated the knowledge
          is  manual or automated.
