               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

**lilpipe** is a lightweight, Pydantic-powered library for building and running sequential workflows in Python. Designed for simplicity and type safety, it’s ideal for data processing, scientific workflows (e.g., ligand-binding assays), and any task requiring a clear, linear sequence of steps. With built-in caching, retries, and composable steps, lilpipe offers a minimal yet robust solution for Python developers who want type-safe pipelines without the complexity of graph-based or distributed systems.

## Features

- **Sequential Workflows**: Run steps in a fixed order, perfect for linear tasks like data processing or lab assays.
- **Pydantic-Powered**: Leverage Pydantic for type-safe, validated configuration and state, integrating seamlessly with FastAPI or data science stacks.
- **Smart Caching**: Skip unchanged steps using fingerprint-based hashing, saving time in iterative workflows.
- **Retries and Control**: Support re-running pipelines (`needs_rerun`) and early termination (`abort_pass`, `abort_run`) for flexible control.
- **Composable Steps**: Nest workflows with `CompositeStep` for modular, reusable pipelines.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies (just Pydantic), ensuring easy installation and low overhead.
- **Bio-Inspired**: Born from ligand-binding assay (LBA) analysis, with potential for lab-specific extensions.
- **Robust Testing**: 100% test coverage, linted with `ruff`, and typed with `mypy`.

## Installation

Install lilpipe via pip:

```bash
pip install lilpipe
```

Requires Python 3.13+ and Pydantic 2.11.7+.

## Usage Example

Below is an example showing a pipeline for processing lab data (e.g., LBA) and a generic data-cleaning pipeline, using `Step`, `CompositeStep`, and `PipelineContext`.

```python
from lilpipe import Step, CompositeStep, Pipeline, PipelineContext

# Define steps for a bio-inspired pipeline
class LoadData(Step):
    name = "load_data"
    def logic(self, ctx: PipelineContext) -> PipelineContext:
        ctx.data = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]  # Simulated assay data
        return ctx

class Calibrate(Step):
    name = "calibrate"
    fingerprint_keys = ("data",)
    def logic(self, ctx: PipelineContext) -> PipelineContext:
        ctx.calibrated = [x * 1.5 for x in ctx.data]  # Calibration factor
        return ctx

class Validate(Step):
    name = "validate"
    def logic(self, ctx: PipelineContext) -> PipelineContext:
        if any(x < 0 for x in ctx.calibrated):
            ctx.needs_rerun = True  # Trigger retry if invalid
        return ctx

# Nested steps for modularity
composite = CompositeStep("process", children=[Calibrate(), Validate()])

# Create and run the pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([LoadData(), composite], name="lba_pipeline", max_loops=3)
ctx = PipelineContext()
pipeline.run(ctx)

print(ctx.calibrated)  # Output: [1.5, 3.0, 4.5]
print(ctx.step_meta)  # Inspect timing, cache hits, etc.

# Generic example: Data cleaning
class CleanData(Step):
    name = "clean"
    fingerprint_keys = ("input",)
    def logic(self, ctx: PipelineContext) -> PipelineContext:
        ctx.output = [x for x in ctx.input if x is not None]
        return ctx

ctx = PipelineContext(input=[1, None, 3])
CleanData().run(ctx)
print(ctx.output)  # Output: [1, 3]
```

Try the full example in our [Jupyter notebook](examples/example.ipynb).

## Why lilpipe?

lilpipe is designed for users who need simple, sequential pipelines without the overhead of complex workflow libraries. Unlike other tools that focus on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), parallel execution, or distributed systems, lilpipe prioritizes:

- **Simplicity**: Linear workflows with a clear, predictable order.
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic-based configuration for robust, validated state.
- **Lightweight Design**: Minimal dependencies and easy setup.
- **Bio-Friendly**: Tailored for lab workflows (e.g., LBA), but flexible for any sequential task.

Choose lilpipe for type-safe, sequential pipelines in Python-centric projects, especially in data science or bio/lab applications, where graph-based or heavy orchestration tools are unnecessary.
