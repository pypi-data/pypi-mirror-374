"""Radar Signal Processing in Jax.

!!! info

    This module mirrors the functionality of [`xwr.rsp.numpy`][xwr.rsp.numpy].

!!! warning

    This module is not automatically imported; you will need to explicitly
    import it:

    ```python
    from xwr.rsp import jax as rsp
    ```

    Since jax is not declared as a required dependency, you will also need
    to install `jax` yourself (or install the `jax` extra with
    `pip install xwr[jax]`).
