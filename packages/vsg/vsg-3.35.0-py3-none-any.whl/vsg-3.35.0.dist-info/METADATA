Announcements
-------------

Update 01/01/2025

The regex definitions for camelCase and PascalCase are going to be changing for release 3.30.0 to better align with industry "standards".

The current regex allows for an unlimited number of uppercase characters in a row:

.. code-block:: bash

   myFIFO
   MyFIFO

A more strict version of camelCase and PascalCase will be implemented to limit the number of consecutive uppercase characters to 2.

.. code-block:: bash

  myFIfo
  MyFIfo

The original regex definition for camelCase will be moved to relaxedCamelCase.
The original regex definition for PascalCase will be moved to RelaxedPascalCase.

If you have a strong opinion on how the regex is defined, your feedback would be appreciated on issue #1202.

Regards,

--Jeremy

Overview
--------

VSG was created after participating in a code review where a real issue in the code was masked by a coding style issue.
A finding was created for the style issue, while the real issue was missed.
When the code was re-reviewed, the real issue was discovered.

Depending on your process, style issues can take a lot of time to resolve.

#. Create finding/ticket/issue
#. Disposition finding/ticket/issue
#. Fix
#. Verify fix

Spending less time on style issues leaves more time to analyze the substance of the code.
This ultimately reduces the amount of time performing code reviews.
It also allows reviewers to focus on the substance of the code.
This will result in a higher quality code base.

Key Benefits
------------

* Define VHDL coding standards
* Makes coding standards visible to everyone
* Improve code reviews
* Quickly bring code up to current standards

VSG allows the style of the code to be defined and enforced over part or the entire code base.
Configurations allow for multiple coding standards.

Key Features
------------

* Command line tool

  * integrate into continuous integration flow with JUnit output

* Reports and fixes issues found

  * whitespace

    * horizontal
    * vertical

  * upper and lower case
  * keyword alignments
  * etc...

* Fully configurable rules via JSON or YAML configuration file

  * Disable rules
  * Alter behavior of existing rules

* Localize rule sets

  * Create your own rules using python
  * Use existing rules as a template
  * Fully integrates into base rule set

* Built in styles

  * Use existing style or create your own

Known Limitations
-----------------

VSG is a continual work in progress.
As such, this version has the following known limitations:

* Parser will not process embedded PSL
* Parser will not process VHDL 2019

Installation
------------

You can get the latest released version of VSG via **pip**.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install vsg

The latest development version can be cloned...

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/jeremiah-c-leary/vhdl-style-guide.git

Install prerequisites.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install tox

Build locally, artifacts will appear in ``dist`` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    tox

Usage
-----

VSG is a both a command line tool and a python package.
The command line tool can be invoked with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ vsg
