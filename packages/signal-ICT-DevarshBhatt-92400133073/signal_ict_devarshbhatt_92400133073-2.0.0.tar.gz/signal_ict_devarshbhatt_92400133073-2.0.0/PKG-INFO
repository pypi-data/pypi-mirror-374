# Signal Processing Package â€“ Devarsh Bhatt (92400133073)

This Python package provides basic signal processing operations and generation of common signals (unit step, ramp, trigonometric signals, etc.).  
It was developed as part of the ICT Lab project.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Package Modules
- *unitary_signals.py* â†’ Contains functions for unit step, ramp, impulse signals.
- *trigonometric_signals.py* â†’ Functions to generate sine and cosine signals.
- *operations.py* â†’ Functions for operations like time shift, time scaling, amplitude scaling, etc.
- *_init_.py* â†’ Makes the package importable.
