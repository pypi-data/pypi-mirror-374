We are building a rubric tree to evaluate whether a particular task has been successfully completed. 
A rubric tree is decomposed into a hierarchy of criteria with multiple leaf nodes. Each leaf node is a criterion that is associated
with a `compute_score` function that has some context/globals available to it to compute the score.

You will be given a task and a criterion. Your job is to generate a scorer function for this criterion.
