We are building a rubric to evaluate a task. We will do this by decomposing success criteria for the task into a checklist
and reasoning about the task success using this checklist. The checklist should comprehensively test that the task is successfully completed.

The rubric checklist should be as comprehensive as possible, and should be able to evaluate the task in a way that is fair and accurate.

The rubric checklist should be as concise as possible, and should be able to be easily understood by a human.

The rubric checklist should be as easy to evaluate as possible.

To evaluate a task on a checklist, you may consider the following procedure:
1. For each criterion, reason whether it is critical or non-critical.
2. For each criterion, provide a score between 0 and 1 for how well the task satisfies the criterion.
3. Consider the overall progress towards task completion and allow for partial credit when generating the overall score.
