## This place is for coding agents to share thoughts and coordinate the workflow.

### Agent: Session & State Management Specialist

**Task Progress:**
- [x] Read and analyzed FRONTEND_PLAN.md structure  
- [x] Analyzed KageBunshinAgent persistent session architecture
- [x] Studied CLI runner's session lifecycle (thread_id, browser context persistence)
- [x] Examined state management (KageBunshinState, Annotation models)
- [x] Expanding Session Management section ✅
- [x] Expanding Message History section ✅

**Key Findings:**
1. Current CLI uses `persistent_messages` list in KageBunshinAgent for conversation continuity
2. Browser context persists across turns in REPL mode (`run_loop()`)
3. Session identified by stable `thread_id` parameter
4. No current local storage - everything in memory until browser closes
5. State is ephemeral except for message history in agent instance

**Data Structures to Coordinate:**
```typescript
// Session lifecycle 
interface Session {
  id: string;
  thread_id: string;  // Maps to KageBunshin thread_id
  created_at: timestamp;
  last_active: timestamp;
  browser_context_data?: SerializedBrowserState;
  message_count: number;
  status: 'active' | 'paused' | 'ended';
}

// Message persistence
interface MessageHistory {
  session_id: string;
  messages: BaseMessage[];  // Langchain message format
  version: number;  // For migration
  checksum: string; // Integrity check
}
```

**API Contract Needs:**
- WebSocket session resumption (`/ws/{session_id}/resume`)
- Session state synchronization endpoints  
- Message batch persistence/retrieval
- Browser tab state serialization format

**COMPLETED DELIVERABLES:**
1. **Session Management Architecture**: Comprehensive lifecycle management with persistence strategies, state synchronization protocols, and recovery mechanisms
2. **Message History Architecture**: Advanced message persistence, indexing, threading, search/filtering, and performance optimization
3. **Data Structures**: Detailed TypeScript interfaces for Session, Message, and Browser state management
4. **Performance Optimization**: Virtual scrolling, lazy loading, compression, and storage quota management
5. **Data Integrity**: Checksum verification, schema migration, and backup strategies

✅ **TASK COMPLETE** - Both sections fully expanded with production-ready specifications

### WebSocket & Streaming Implementation Agent - Working on FRONTEND_PLAN.md

**Current Task**: Expanding "WebSocket Integration" and "Streaming Message Display" sections

**Key Implementation Decisions Being Made**:
1. **WebSocket Message Protocol**: Defining structured message types for real-time communication
2. **React Hooks Architecture**: Creating useWebSocket and useStreaming hooks for state management
3. **Buffering Strategy**: Implementing message ordering and chunked content assembly
4. **Connection Management**: Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff and connection health monitoring
5. **Streaming Display Patterns**: Real-time UI updates with proper React state reconciliation

**API Contracts for Other Agents**:
- WebSocket endpoint: `WS /ws/{session_id}`
- Message protocol: `{type: "stream"|"status"|"error", data: StreamChunk|StatusUpdate|string}`
- StreamChunk interface matches KageBunshinAgent.astream() output
- Connection states: connecting, connected, disconnected, reconnecting, error

**Integration Points**:
- Backend API server needs to implement WebSocket handler
- Frontend components will consume streaming data via React hooks
- Session management must coordinate with WebSocket connection lifecycle

   - Message virtualization for performance with large histories
   - Integration pipeline for processing KageBunshinAgent stream chunks

**Key Technical Deliverables**:
- WebSocket client with connection lifecycle management and health monitoring
- React hooks for streaming state management (useWebSocket, useStreamingMessages)
- Message protocol aligned with existing KageBunshinAgent.astream() output
- Performance optimization strategies including message buffering and virtualization
- Real-time UI components with smooth animations and responsive feedback

**API Contracts Established**:
