        async def click(bbox_id: int) -> str:
            """Click on an interactive element identified by its bounding box ID.

            This is Kagebunshin's core interaction tool that uses a sophisticated hybrid execution strategy
            for maximum reliability. It first attempts fast native Playwright clicks, then automatically 
            falls back to human-like mouse movements if needed. Essential for all user interface interactions.

            ## Purpose & Use Cases

            **Primary Interactions:**
            - Click buttons, links, and interactive elements
            - Submit forms and trigger form actions
            - Navigate through websites and applications
            - Activate dropdown menus and select options
            - Trigger JavaScript events and dynamic content loading
            - Interact with modal dialogs and popups
            - Activate image galleries, carousels, and media players

            **Advanced Scenarios:**
            - Handle anti-bot detection systems with human-like fallback
            - Interact with complex single-page applications
            - Trigger AJAX requests and dynamic page updates
            - Navigate through multi-step workflows and wizards
            - Activate hover-dependent elements that require precise clicking

            ## Arguments

            **bbox_id** (int, required):
            - The ID number of the bounding box element from the page annotation
            - Must correspond to a currently visible interactive element
            - Invalid IDs will raise ValueError with valid range information

            ## Returns

            **Success responses:**
            - `"Successfully clicked element {bbox_id}."` - Native click succeeded
            - `"Successfully clicked element {bbox_id} using fallback."` - Human-like fallback succeeded

            **Error responses:**
            - `"Error: Clicking element {bbox_id} had no effect on the page."` - Click registered but no page change
            - `"Error: All click attempts failed for element {bbox_id}. Last error: {details}"` - Complete failure

            ## Behavior Details

            **Hybrid Execution Strategy:**
            1. **Native Click Attempt**: Fast Playwright click with 5-second timeout
            2. **Page State Verification**: Compares URL, DOM hash, and tab count before/after
            3. **Human-like Fallback**: If native click fails or has no effect:
               - Calculates random offset within element bounds
               - Performs realistic mouse movement from current position
               - Adds human-like delays (50-200ms) before clicking
               - Uses random click coordinates to avoid bot detection patterns

            **New Tab Detection:**
            - Automatically detects if click opened new tabs
            - Switches to newest tab if new tabs are opened
            - Updates internal page tracking for seamless continuation
            - Logs tab switches for user awareness

            **Action Verification:**
            - Captures page state (URL, DOM hash, tab count) before clicking
            - Waits 1 second after click for page updates to complete
            - Compares before/after state to confirm click had effect
            - Only increments action counter if page state actually changed

            ## Important Notes

            **Element Validation:**
            - Invalid bbox_id values trigger immediate error with valid range
            - Elements must be currently visible and accessible on the page
            - Some elements may require hovering first to become clickable

            **Timing and Delays:**
            - Native clicks execute immediately for maximum speed
            - Human-like fallback includes realistic delays and mouse movement
            - 1-second wait after clicking allows page updates to complete
            - Smart delays between actions help maintain human-like behavior

            **Success Criteria:**
            - Click is considered successful only if page state changes
            - Page changes include URL changes, DOM updates, or new tabs opening
            - Clicks that don't change page state are reported as having "no effect"
            - This prevents false positives from non-functional elements

            ## Troubleshooting

            **"Clicking element had no effect":**
            - Element may not be functional (decorative or disabled)
            - Element may require hover() activation before clicking
            - Page may need scrolling to properly load the element

            **"All click attempts failed":**
            - Element may not be clickable (covered by another element)
            - Element selector may be invalid or element removed from page
            - Page may have changed, requiring fresh page annotation
            - Network issues may be preventing interaction

            **New tabs not switching correctly:**
            - Kagebunshin automatically switches to new tabs when detected
            - If tab switching seems wrong, use list_tabs() and switch_tab() manually
            - Some sites open tabs in background - check tab status with list_tabs()

            ## Best Practices

            **Reliable Clicking:**
            - Always verify click success by checking return messages
            - Use extract_page_content() or take_note() to confirm expected results
            - If clicks fail, try hover() first to activate hover-dependent elements
            - Consider scroll() if element might be partially off-screen

            **Form Interactions:**
            - Click form elements in logical order (top to bottom)
            - Verify form submission success before proceeding
            - Use press_enter parameter in type_text() as alternative to clicking submit buttons
            - Take notes after successful form submissions for tracking

            **Error Recovery:**
            - If native click fails, the human-like fallback runs automatically
            - For persistent failures, try refresh()
            - Use browser_goto() to restart if page becomes unresponsive

            ## Integration with Kagebunshin Features

            **Stealth and Anti-Detection:**
            - Human-like fallback uses realistic mouse movement patterns
            - Random click coordinates within element bounds avoid detection
            - Variable delays and movements simulate natural human behavior
            - Automatic fallback ensures maximum success rate across different sites

            **Multi-Tab Management:**
            - Automatically handles new tabs opened by clicks
            - Maintains context across tab switches
            - Updates internal page tracking seamlessly
            - Enables complex multi-tab workflows without manual management

            ## Purpose & Use Cases

            **Form Interactions:**
            - Fill out login forms (username, password fields)
            - Complete registration and contact forms
            - Enter search queries and filter criteria
            - Input personal information, addresses, phone numbers

            - Handle input fields with character limits or special requirements
            - Work with rich text editors and formatted input areas

            ## Arguments

            **bbox_id** (int, required):
            - The ID number of the input element from the page annotation
            - Must correspond to a text input element (input, textarea, contenteditable)
            - Valid range is 0 to (number of detected elements - 1)
            - Invalid IDs will raise ValueError with valid range information

            **text_content** (str, required):
            - The text to input into the element
            - Can be any string including special characters, numbers, symbols
            - Supports Unicode characters for international text
            - Empty strings are allowed (useful for clearing fields)
            - Line breaks (\\n) are supported for textarea elements

            **press_enter** (bool, optional):
            - Whether to press Enter key after typing text
            - Defaults to False (no Enter key press)
            - Set to True for search fields and single-line forms
            - Useful for submitting forms without clicking submit buttons
            - Alternative to clicking submit buttons in many workflows
            - **WARNING:** If the search field is likely to be a dropdown, set press_enter=False

            ## Returns

            **Success responses:**
            - `"Successfully typed '{text_content}' into element {bbox_id}."` - Native input succeeded

            - `"Error: All type attempts failed for element {bbox_id}. Last error: {details}"` - Complete failure

            ## Behavior Details

            **Form Submission Options:**
            - press_enter=True sends Enter key after typing
            - Useful for search forms and single-field submissions
            - Alternative to clicking submit buttons
            - Works with both native and human-like input modes

            ## Important Notes

            **Field Clearing:**
            - Both native and human-like modes clear existing content first
            - Native mode uses Playwright's fill() which replaces content
            - Human-like mode uses Select All + Backspace for natural behavior
            - Essential for fields that may have placeholder or existing text

            **Input Validation Handling:**
            - Some forms validate input in real-time during typing
            - Human-like typing may trigger validation at each character
            - Native input may bypass some client-side validation
            - Both modes wait for page state changes to complete

            **Focus and Interaction:**
            - Human-like mode clicks the element to ensure proper focus
            - Uses random click coordinates within element bounds
            - Handles focus-dependent elements and input activation
            - Maintains natural interaction patterns for anti-detection

            ## Troubleshooting

            **"Typing had no effect":**
            - Element may not be a valid input field
            - Element may be disabled or read-only
            - JavaScript may be preventing input
            - Try click() on the element first to activate it

            **Text not appearing correctly:**
            - Some fields have input formatting that changes appearance
            - Rich text editors may modify content during input
            - Auto-completion may alter or complete text
            - Special characters may need escaping or alternative input methods

            ## Best Practices

            **Form Filling Strategy:**
            - Fill fields in logical top-to-bottom order
            - Use take_note() to track successful form submissions
            - Verify field content with extract_page_content() for critical data
            - Test both native and fallback approaches for problematic fields

            **Text Input Optimization:**
            - Use press_enter=True for single-field forms (search boxes)
            - Clear understanding of field requirements (length, format, validation)
            - Handle special characters carefully - test with simple text first
            - Consider scroll() if input field is not fully visible

            **Error Recovery:**
            - If native input fails, human-like fallback runs automatically
            - For persistent failures, try refresh() and re-annotate the page
            - Use hover() before typing if element requires activation
            - Consider click() to focus problematic input elements

            ## Advanced Features

            """Scroll the page or specific elements to reveal more content with human-like scrolling patterns.

            This tool provides realistic scrolling functionality that mimics natural human scrolling behavior,
            breaking scroll actions into multiple smaller increments with variable timing. Essential for 
            navigating long pages, infinite scroll content, and accessing off-screen elements.

            ## Purpose & Use Cases

            **Page Navigation:**

            - Navigate through search results and listings
            - Access footer information and additional page sections

            **Dynamic Content Loading:**
            - Trigger lazy-loaded images and content sections
            - Activate infinite scroll mechanisms for more results
            - Load additional product recommendations and suggestions
            - Reveal sticky navigation and scroll-triggered elements
            - Access content that appears only after scrolling
            - Trigger scroll-based animations and interactions

            **Element-Specific Scrolling:**
            - Scroll within dropdown menus and select lists
            - Navigate through scrollable tables and data grids
            - Browse content within modal dialogs and sidebars
            - Scroll through textarea content and code blocks
            - Navigate within embedded frames and widgets

            ## Arguments

            **target** (str, required):
            - `"page"` - Scroll the entire page/window (most common usage)
            - `"{bbox_id}"` - Scroll within a specific scrollable element (e.g., "5", "12")
            - Target must be either literal "page" string or valid bbox_id number as string
            - For element scrolling, bbox_id must correspond to a scrollable container
            - Invalid bbox_id values will result in clear error messages

            **direction** (str, required):
            - `"up"` - Scroll upward to reveal content above current viewport
            - `"down"` - Scroll downward to reveal content below current viewport  
            - Case-insensitive ("UP", "Down", "DOWN" all work)
            - Only these two directions are supported

            ## Returns
            **Success response:** `"Successfully scrolled {direction}"`
            **Error responses:**
            - `"Error: Direction must be 'up' or 'down'"` - Invalid direction parameter
            - `"Error: Invalid bbox_id {target}"` - Element target not found
            - `"Error: Could not get bounding box for element {target}"` - Element not accessible
            - `"Error: Element with bbox_id {target} not found"` - Element no longer exists
            - `"Error scrolling: {details}"` - General scrolling failure

            ## Behavior Details

            **Page Scrolling:**
            - Default scroll amount: 500 pixels per action
            - Automatically adapts to page height and content
            - Maintains smooth scrolling performance across different page types
            - Handles both short pages and very long content effectively
            - Works with sticky headers, fixed navigation, and complex layouts

            **Element Scrolling:**
            - Default scroll amount: 200 pixels for contained elements
            - Works with scrollable divs, tables, dropdown lists, and containers
            - Automatically detects element boundaries and scroll limits
            - Handles nested scrollable elements correctly
            - Maintains element focus and visibility during scrolling

            ## Important Notes

            **Scroll Target Selection:**
            - Page scrolling works on all websites and is the most reliable option
            - Element scrolling requires the target to be a scrollable container
            - Not all elements with content overflow support programmatic scrolling
            - Some custom scrollable elements may not respond to standard scroll events

            **Content Loading Considerations:**
            - Many modern sites use lazy loading triggered by scrolling
            - Infinite scroll mechanisms often require specific scroll positions
            - Some content may take time to load after scrolling (images, ads, widgets)
            - Dynamic content may change page height and available scroll space

            **Timing and Performance:**
            - Human-like scrolling is slower than instant scrolling but more reliable
            - Multiple increments help trigger scroll-based events and animations
            - Proper timing prevents overwhelming servers with rapid scroll requests
            - Realistic patterns help avoid scroll-based bot detection

            ## Troubleshooting

            **Scrolling has no visible effect:**
            - Page may already be at scroll limit (top/bottom)
            - Check if page actually has scrollable content
            - Some single-page applications may override scroll behavior
            - Try scrolling in opposite direction to confirm functionality

            **Element scrolling not working:**
            - Verify the element is actually scrollable (has overflow content)
            - Element may be a display container rather than scrollable element
            - Try page scrolling instead if element scrolling fails
            - Some custom elements use different scroll implementations

            **Content not loading after scroll:**
            - Use wait_for() with time delay to allow content loading
            - Some lazy-loading requires multiple scroll actions to trigger
            - Check network connectivity if external content isn't loading
            - Consider refresh() if scrolling seems to break page functionality

            ## Best Practices

            **Efficient Content Discovery:**
            - Scroll incrementally and check content with extract_page_content()
            - Use take_note() to track your position and findings during exploration
            - Plan scroll strategy based on expected page layout and content structure
            - Combine scrolling with targeted element searching for efficiency

            **Infinite Scroll Management:**
            - Always include wait_for() delays after scrolling on infinite scroll pages
            - Monitor for duplicate content that indicates you've reached the end
            - Set reasonable limits to avoid infinite scrolling loops
            - Use take_note() to track total items loaded or progress made

            **Element Interaction Preparation:**
            - Scroll elements into view before attempting to interact with them
            - Some elements become clickable only when fully visible
            - Use scroll() before hover() or click() on partially visible elements
            - Consider page scrolling if element scrolling doesn't provide needed visibility

            ## Integration with Kagebunshin Features

            **Human-like Behavior Simulation:**
            - Multiple small scrolls mimic natural human scrolling patterns

            - Works seamlessly with other human-like interaction tools
            - Maintains consistent behavioral patterns across browser sessions

            **Dynamic Content Support:**
            - Handles modern single-page applications and dynamic content loading
            - Compatible with JavaScript-heavy sites that modify content on scroll
            - Works with Progressive Web Apps and complex web applications
            - Supports both traditional page layouts and modern app interfaces

            Behavior Details:
            - Key press is sent to the currently focused element
            - If no element has focus, key press affects the page/window
            - Action count is incremented after successful key press
            - Key names are case-sensitive and must match Playwright conventions
            
            Important Notes:
            - Some key combinations may be intercepted by the browser
            - Certain keys may trigger page navigation (F5 for refresh)
            - Focus must be on appropriate element for keys to have effect
            - Modifier keys (Control, Shift, Alt) can be combined with other keys
            - Key behavior depends on the currently focused element type
            
            Troubleshooting:
            - If key has no effect, check if correct element has focus
            - Some keys may require specific focus context to work
            - Browser security may block certain key combinations
            - Custom JavaScript may override default key behavior

            This tool simulates clicking and holding on one element, dragging it to
            another location, and releasing it. This is essential for interacting
            with drag-and-drop interfaces, reordering lists, and moving content.
            
            Use drag and drop for:
            - Reordering items in sortable lists
            - Moving files between folders in file managers
            - Rearranging dashboard widgets or panels
            - Dragging items into shopping carts
            - Organizing content in kanban boards or project tools
            - Adjusting sliders or range controls
            - Moving elements in design interfaces
            - Drag-to-select operations
            
            Args:
                start_bbox_id (int): The ID of the element to start dragging from.
                                   Must correspond to a draggable element on the current page.
                                   Valid range is 0 to (number of detected elements - 1).
                end_bbox_id (int): The ID of the element to drop onto (drop target).

            Behavior Details:
            - Uses native Playwright drag_and_drop() method
            - Automatically handles mouse down, move, and up events
            - Action count is incremented after successful drag operation
            - Both source and target elements must be valid and accessible
            
            Important Notes:
            - Invalid bbox_id values will raise ValueError with valid range
            - Both elements must exist and be visible on the page
            - Some drag operations may trigger page updates or animations
            - Not all elements support drag and drop (depends on implementation)
            - Source element must have draggable properties enabled
            - Target element must be a valid drop zone
            
            Drag and Drop Requirements:
            - **Source element** must be draggable (draggable="true" or CSS draggable)
            - **Target element** must accept drops (proper drop event handlers)
            - **JavaScript handlers** must be present to process the drop
            - **Browser support** for HTML5 drag and drop API
            
            Troubleshooting:
            - If drag fails, check if elements actually support drag/drop
            - Some interfaces use custom drag implementations that may not work
            - Try hover() on source element first to activate drag handles
            - Verify both source and target elements are currently visible
            - Some drag operations require specific mouse positions within elements
            
            Alternative Approaches:
            - For simple reordering, look for up/down arrow buttons
            - Some interfaces use context menus instead of drag/drop
            - Touch-based interfaces may use different interaction patterns

            """Wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding with automation tasks.

            This tool provides flexible waiting mechanisms essential for handling dynamic content,
            slow-loading pages, and asynchronous operations. It supports both time-based delays
            and element state monitoring for robust automation workflows.

            ## Purpose & Use Cases

            **Dynamic Content Loading:**
            - Wait for AJAX requests and API calls to complete
            - Allow lazy-loaded images and content to appear
            - Wait for JavaScript-rendered content to become available
            - Handle progressive loading and content streaming
            - Wait for advertising and analytics scripts to finish loading

            **Element State Management:**
            - Wait for buttons and interactive elements to become clickable
            - Monitor for modal dialogs and popups to appear or disappear
            - Wait for form validation messages and error states
            - Track loading spinners and progress indicators
            - Monitor for content updates and state changes

            **Timing and Synchronization:**
            - Add strategic delays between rapid actions
            - Allow page transitions and animations to complete
            - Synchronize with external systems and services
            - Handle rate limiting and throttling requirements
            - Provide breathing room for complex page interactions

            ## Arguments

            **time** (float, optional):
            - Number of seconds to wait (supports decimals like 1.5, 2.3)
            - Valid range: 0.1 to 20.0 seconds (20 second maximum for safety)
            - Use for simple time-based delays and loading periods
            - Essential for allowing content to load after actions
            - If None, element-based waiting is used instead

            **bbox_id** (int, optional):
            - The ID number of the element to monitor from page annotation
            - Must correspond to a valid element detected on the page
            - Used with state parameter to wait for element changes
            - If None, time-based waiting is used instead

            **state** (str, optional):
            - `"attached"` (default): Wait for element to appear in the DOM
            - `"detached"`: Wait for element to disappear from the DOM
            - Only relevant when bbox_id is provided
            - Case-sensitive - must use exact strings
            - Timeout of 5 seconds maximum for element state changes

            ## Returns

            **Success responses:**
            - `"Waited for {time} seconds."` - Time-based wait completed
            - `"Waited for element {bbox_id} to appear."` - Element appeared successfully
            - `"Waited for element {bbox_id} to disappear."` - Element disappeared successfully

            **Error responses:**
            - `"Error: Time cannot be greater than 20 seconds"` - Time limit exceeded
            - `"Error: Time cannot be negative"` - Invalid negative time
            - `"Error: state must be 'attached' or 'detached'"` - Invalid state parameter
            - `"No wait condition provided."` - Neither time nor bbox_id specified
            - `"Error in wait_for: {details}"` - Element wait timeout or other failure

            ## Behavior Details

            **Time-Based Waiting:**
            - Converts time to milliseconds for precise Playwright timeout
            - Blocks execution for exactly the specified duration
            - Supports fractional seconds for fine-grained control

            **Element State Waiting:**
            - Uses Playwright's selector waiting with 5-second timeout
            - "attached" waits for element to become present in DOM
            - "detached" waits for element to be removed from DOM
            - Automatically handles dynamic element creation and removal
            - Fails gracefully if timeout exceeded

            **Wait Strategy Selection:**
            - If both time and bbox_id provided, time takes precedence
            - If neither provided, returns error message
            - Element waiting is more reliable for dynamic content
            - Time waiting is simpler but less adaptive

            ## Important Notes

            **Time Limits and Safety:**
            - 20-second maximum prevents infinite hangs
            - Consider shorter waits (1-5 seconds) for most use cases
            - Very long waits may indicate architectural problems
            - Use element waiting instead of long time waits when possible

            **Element State Monitoring:**
            - 5-second timeout prevents indefinite waiting for elements
            - Elements must be detectable by page annotation system
            - Some dynamically created elements may not be immediately detectable
            - State changes are detected through DOM monitoring

            **Performance Considerations:**
            - Time-based waits block all activity during wait period
            - Element waits are more efficient and responsive
            - Use shortest practical wait times to maintain performance
            - Consider async loading patterns when designing wait strategies

            ## Best Practices

            **Strategic Wait Placement:**
            - Add waits after actions that trigger loading (click, scroll, navigation)
            - Wait before accessing content that may not be immediately available
            - Use shorter waits (0.5-2 seconds) for most interactive elements
            - Reserve longer waits (3+ seconds) for major page changes

            **Choosing Wait Types:**
            - Use element waiting for predictable state changes
            - Use time waiting for general loading delays
            - Combine both types for robust handling of complex scenarios
            - Monitor actual page behavior to optimize wait strategies

            **Performance Optimization:**
            - Start with shorter waits and increase only if needed
            - Use element waiting to avoid unnecessary delays
            - Batch related actions to minimize total wait time
            - Monitor automation speed vs. reliability balance

            fast native Playwright selection first, then falling back to human-like mouse interactions 
            if needed. Essential for form completion, filtering, and configuration selections.

            ## Purpose & Use Cases

            **Form Completion:**
            - Select country, state, or region from dropdown lists
            - Choose categories, departments, or classifications
            - Pick dates, times, or time zones from select elements

            ## Arguments

            **bbox_id** (int, required):
            - The ID number of the select/dropdown element from page annotation
            - Must correspond to a `<select>` element or dropdown component
            - Valid range is 0 to (number of detected elements - 1)
            - Invalid IDs will raise ValueError with valid range information

            **values** (List[str], required):
            - List of option values to select (supports single or multiple selections)
            - Values should match the HTML `value` attributes of `<option>` elements
            - For single-select dropdowns: provide list with one value `["option1"]`
            - For multi-select elements: provide multiple values `["option1", "option2"]`
            - Empty list `[]` will clear all selections
            - Case-sensitive - must match exact option values

            ## Returns

            **Success responses:**
            - `"Successfully selected {values} in element {bbox_id}."` - Native selection succeeded
            - `"Successfully selected {values} in element {bbox_id} using fallback."` - Human-like fallback succeeded

            **Error responses:**
            - `"Error: Selecting in element {bbox_id} had no effect on the page."` - Selection registered but no page change
            - `"Error: All select attempts failed for element {bbox_id}. Last error: {details}"` - Complete failure

            ## Behavior Details

            **Multi-Select Support:**
            - Handles both single-select (`<select>`) and multi-select (`<select multiple>`) elements
            - For multi-select: all specified values are selected simultaneously
            - Previous selections may be cleared or maintained depending on element behavior
            - Native method handles multi-select efficiently in single operation

            **Option Value Matching:**
            - Values must match HTML `value` attributes exactly (case-sensitive)
            - If option has no explicit value, uses the visible text as value
            - Some dropdowns use numeric IDs or codes as values
            - Custom dropdown components may have non-standard value formats

            ## Important Notes
            **State Change Detection:**
            - Selection is considered successful only if page state changes
            - Some dropdowns trigger immediate form submission or page updates
            - Others may require additional action (button click) to apply selection
            - Changes include DOM updates, AJAX requests, or visual state changes

            ## Troubleshooting

            **"Selection had no effect":**
            - Selected values may not exist in the dropdown options
            - Dropdown may require additional action (Apply button) after selection
            - Some dropdowns are disabled or read-only
            - JavaScript may prevent selection or override the choice

            **Values not found or invalid:**
            - Use extract_page_content() to inspect available option values
            - Check HTML source to find exact `value` attributes
            - Some options may be dynamically loaded after opening dropdown
            - Custom dropdowns may use different value formats

            **Multiple selection issues:**
            - Verify the element supports multiple selections (`<select multiple>`)
            - Some elements clear previous selections when new ones are made
            - Order of values in list may matter for some implementations
            - Try selecting options individually if batch selection fails

            ## Best Practices

            **Value Discovery:**
            - Use extract_page_content() or hover() to reveal available options
            - Inspect element HTML to find correct value attributes
            - Test with simple, common values first (like "1", "yes", "true")
            - Watch for dynamic loading of dropdown options

            **Form Workflow:**
            - Select dropdown options before filling related text fields
            - Some dropdowns may affect what other fields are available
            - Complete dropdowns in logical order (country → state → city)
            - Verify selection success before proceeding to dependent fields

            **Error Recovery:**
            - If native selection fails, human-like fallback runs automatically
            - For persistent failures, try clicking dropdown first with click()
            - Consider using hover() to activate dropdown before selection
            - Use refresh() if dropdown seems broken or unresponsive

            ## Advanced Features

            **Dynamic Dropdown Handling:**
            - Handles dropdowns that load options via AJAX
            - Works with cascading dropdowns that update based on previous selections
            - Supports dropdowns that filter or search as you type
            - Compatible with modern framework dropdown components

            **Anti-Detection Integration:**
            - Human-like fallback uses realistic mouse movement and timing

            Tab Information Details:
            - **Tab Index**: 0-based numbering for use with other tab tools
            - **Title**: Page title as reported by the browser
            - **URL**: Full URL of the page
            - **Active Status**: Shows which tab is currently focused and receiving actions
            
            Important Notes:
            - Tab indices start at 0 (first tab is index 0)
            - Active tab receives all browser actions (click, type, etc.)
            - Tab order may change as tabs are opened and closed
            
            Best Practices:
            - Call list_tabs() in order to get detailed tab information
            - Use tab titles and URLs to identify the correct tab
            - Note the active tab before switching to ensure you can return
            
            Common Tab States:
            - **Single tab**: Normal browsing, all actions go to one page
            - **Multiple tabs**: Need to track which tab is active
            - **New tabs from clicks**: Links may open in new tabs automatically
            - **Background tabs**: Tabs that loaded but aren't currently active

            workflows and parallel browsing tasks.
            
            Use switch_tab when:
            - Working with multiple tabs simultaneously
            - Comparing information across different pages
            - Returning to a previously opened tab
            - Managing parallel browsing workflows
            - Accessing background tabs that were opened earlier

                     error message if the switch failed or tab index is invalid.
            
            Tab Switching Behavior:
            - **Focus change**: The specified tab becomes the active tab
            - **Action redirection**: All subsequent tools operate on the new active tab
            - **Visual activation**: The tab is brought to the front (becomes visible)
            - **State preservation**: Previous tab remains loaded in background
            - **Action counting**: Tab switches increment the action counter
            
            Important Notes:
            - Invalid tab indices will return an error with valid range information
            - The active tab receives all browser actions after switching
            - Background tabs remain loaded and maintain their state
            - Some tabs may take time to fully re-render when switching
            
            Error Conditions:
            - Tab index out of range (negative or >= number of tabs)

            - Browser context has been destroyed
            - Network issues preventing tab activation
            
            **Common Multi-Tab Scenarios:**
            - **Price comparison**: Multiple store tabs for comparison
            - **Research verification**: Multiple source tabs for fact-checking
            - **Form management**: Multiple application forms in parallel
            - **Documentation**: One tab for research, one for note-taking
            - **Workflow coordination**: Main task tab plus reference tabs

            New Tab Behavior:
            - **Automatic activation**: New tab becomes the active tab immediately
            - **Fresh context**: New tab starts with clean state (no history, cookies isolated)
            - **Index assignment**: New tab gets the highest index number
            - **Action redirection**: All subsequent tools operate on the new tab
            - **Resource allocation**: New tab consumes browser memory and resources
            
            Important Notes:
            - New tab automatically becomes active (no need to call switch_tab)
            - If URL is provided, navigation happens automatically
            - URL navigation follows same rules as browser_goto() (timeouts, redirects, etc.)

            - Too many tabs can impact browser performance
            
            Best Practices:
            - Plan your multi-tab strategy before opening many tabs
            - Use descriptive take_note() calls to track tab purposes
            - Close tabs when no longer needed to free resources
            - Consider whether you need the tab immediately or can open it later

            Tab Closing Behavior:
            - **Resource cleanup**: Tab memory and processes are freed
            - **Automatic switching**: If current tab is closed, switches to first available tab
            - **Index adjustment**: Remaining tabs may have their indices renumbered
            - **State preservation**: Other tabs remain unaffected
            - **Action counting**: Tab closure increments the action counter
            - **Safety protection**: Cannot close the last remaining tab
            
            Important Notes:
            - Cannot close the last remaining tab (browser must have at least one tab)
            - If closing the current tab, automatically switches to another tab
            - Tab indices may change after closing a tab (tabs get renumbered)
            - Any unsaved data in the closed tab will be lost
            - Background processes in the closed tab are terminated
            
            **Best Practices for Tab Management:**
            
            **Strategic Closing:**
            - Close tabs immediately after extracting needed information
            - Don't accumulate many tabs - close as you go
            - Keep only essential tabs open at any time
            - Close tabs in reverse order to avoid index confusion
            
            **Remember:** Closing tabs is permanent - any unsaved data will be lost.
