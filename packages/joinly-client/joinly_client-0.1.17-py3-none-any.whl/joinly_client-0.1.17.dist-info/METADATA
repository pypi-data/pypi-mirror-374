# joinly-client: Client for a conversational meeting agent used with joinly

## Prerequisites

### Set LLM API key

Export a valid API key for the LLM provider you want to use, e.g. OpenAI:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Or, create a `.env` file in the current directory with the following content:
```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

For other providers, export the corresponding environment variable(s) and set provider and model with the command:
```bash
uvx joinly-client --llm-provider <provider> --llm-model <model> <MeetingUrl>
```

### Start joinly server

Make sure you have a running joinly server. You can start it with:
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/joinly-ai/joinly:latest
```
For more details on joinly, see the GitHub repository: [joinly-ai/joinly](https://github.com/joinly-ai/joinly).

## Command line usage

We recommend using `uv` for running the client, you can install it using the [command in their repository](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#Installation).

Connect to a running joinly server and join a meeting, here loading environment variables from a `.env` file:
```bash
uvx joinly-client --joinly-url http://localhost:8000/mcp/ --env-file .env <MeetingUrl>
```

Add other MCP servers using a [configuration file](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client#configuration-based-clients):
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "localServer": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "package@0.1.0"]
        },
        "remoteServer": {
            "url": "http://mcp.example.com",
            "auth": "oauth"
        }
    }
}
```

```bash
uvx joinly-client --mcp-config config.json <MeetingUrl>
```

You can also set other session-specific settings for the joinly server, e.g.:
```bash
uvx joinly-client --tts elevenlabs --tts-arg voice_id=EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMa6 --lang de <MeetingUrl>
```

For a full list of command line options, run:
```bash
uvx joinly-client --help
```

## Code usage

Direct use of run function:
```python
import asyncio

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from joinly_client import run

load_dotenv()


async def async_run():
    await run(
        joinly_url="http://localhost:8000/mcp/",
        meeting_url="<MeetingUrl>",
        llm_provider="openai",
        llm_model="gpt-4o-mini",
        prompt="You are joinly, a...",
        name="joinly",
        name_trigger=False,
        mcp_config=None,  # MCP servers configuration (dict)
        settings=None,  # settings propagated to joinly server (dict)
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(async_run())
```

Or only using the client and a custom agent:
```python
import asyncio

from joinly_client import JoinlyClient
from joinly_client.types import TranscriptSegment


async def run():
    client = JoinlyClient(
        url="http://localhost:8000/mcp/",
        name="joinly",
        name_trigger=False,
        settings=None,
    )

    async def on_utterance(segments: list[TranscriptSegment]) -> None:
        for segment in segments:
            print(f"Received utterance: {segment.text}")
            if "marco" in segment.text.lower():
                await client.speak_text("Polo!")

    client.add_utterance_callback(on_utterance)

    async with client:
        # optionally, load all tools from the server
        # can be used to give all tools to the llm
        # e.g., for langchain mcp adapter, use the client.session
        tool_list = await client.list_tools()

        await client.join_meeting("<MeetingUrl>")
        try:
            await asyncio.Event().wait()  # wait until cancelled
        finally:
            print(await client.get_transcript())  # print the final transcript


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run())
```
