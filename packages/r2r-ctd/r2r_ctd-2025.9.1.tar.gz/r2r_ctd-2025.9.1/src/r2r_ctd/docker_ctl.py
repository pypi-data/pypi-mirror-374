"""Utilities for interacting with and managing the lifecycle of the companion container.

Basic architecture is as follows:

* A single container will exist for the lifetime of this python process, it will not be launched unless needed.
* A single temporary directory will be mapped into that container, which will be cleaned up when the python process exits.
* The functions that run things, will create their own temporary directory inside that will be cleaned up when these functions return (or throw).
* The functions work by creating a small shell script inside their temporary directory and calling that.
* As a convention, the shell script is placed inside an ``sh`` directory, the input files in an ``in`` directory, and container output files placed in an ``out`` directory
* The container will be killed when python exist.
* If the wine debugger is entered, the container is restarted and the routine is tried again.

Temporary directory structure::

  tmp_container  <-- gets bound to the container when first launched
  └── tmp_func <-- created inside the above temporary dir when each function is called
      ├── in <-- has input files (xmlcon, hex, etc..)
      ├── out <-- gets output files written (or moved)
      └── sh <-- shell scripts that run the SBE Software

The above architecture is largely due to many lessons learned during development:

The container stays running due to a very large startup cost.
    Earlier versions of this software launched/removed the container with each function call.
    However, when monitoring resource usage, there was significant hard disk activity (GBs being read/written at launch).
    This was fixed/mitigated somewhat by improvements to the container image itself, but by the time those improvements were made, this had already switched to using a single container architecture.
    Even with the improved container, it was still faster and less hard on my hard drive when a single container was used.

The nested temporary directories are due to two requirements.
    When the container is launched, we need to bind some directory as a volume mount to get data in/out of the container.
    This directory needs to exist when the container is launched, and exist for the lifetime of the container.
    Each function needs to add it own files for processing, temporary directories are used here so that they are cleaned up when the function exits.
    This avoids functions conflicting with each other and for this software to try to clean up individual files itself.

Shell scripts are mapped in rather than baked in.
    To keep the container itself portable and not need rebuilds constantly, it's easier to add the shell scripts at runtime rather than at image build time.
    This also increases the utility of that container image outside of this QA content.
