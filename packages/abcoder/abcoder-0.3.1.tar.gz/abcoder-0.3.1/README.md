# abcoder

Agentic backend coder - A Jupyter notebook manager with MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for AI-assisted code execution and bioinformatics workflows.

**Supports multiple Jupyter kernels (Python, R, etc.) for parallel notebook management.**

## ü™© What can it do?

- **Jupyter Notebook Management**: Create, switch between, and manage multiple Jupyter notebooks
- **Multi-kernel Support**: Manage and run code in multiple Jupyter kernels (e.g., Python, R) simultaneously
- **Code Execution**: Execute single-step or multi-step code in Jupyter kernels
- **Variable Backup**: Safely backup variables before code execution to prevent data loss
- **API Documentation**: Query function and API documentation directly from the kernel
- **Output Handling**: Capture and display execution results, errors, and generated figures
- **Bioinformatics Integration**: Designed for bioinformatics workflows with support for common libraries like scanpy, pandas, numpy, etc.

## ‚ùì Who is this for?

- **Bioinformaticians** who want AI assistance in their Jupyter workflows
- **AI developers** building agents that need to execute code in Jupyter environments
- **Researchers** who want to integrate AI tools with their computational notebooks
- **Anyone** who wants to use natural language to control Jupyter notebook execution

## üåê Where to use it?

You can use abcoder in most AI clients, plugins, or agent frameworks that support the MCP:

- **AI clients**: Cherry Studio, Claude Desktop, etc.
- **Plugins**: Cline, etc.
- **Agent frameworks**: Agno, etc.

## üèéÔ∏è Quickstart

### Install

Install from PyPI:
```bash
pip install abcoder
```

Test the installation:
```bash
abcoder run
```

### Configuration

#### Run abcoder locally

First, check the installation path:
```bash
which abcoder
# Example output: /home/user/bin/abcoder
```

Configure your MCP client:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "abcoder": {
      "command": "/home/user/bin/abcoder",
      "args": ["run"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Run abcoder remotely

Start the server on your remote machine:
```bash
abcoder run --transport shttp --port 8000
```

Configure your local MCP client:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "abcoder": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
