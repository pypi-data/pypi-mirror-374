🎭 Information Bottleneck Transform & Predict Module
==================================================

Author: Benedict Chen (benedict@benedictchen.com)

This module contains the transformation and prediction functions for the Information
Bottleneck method. These functions enable applying trained IB models to new data,
providing information-theoretically optimal representations and predictions.

Based on: Naftali Tishby, Fernando C. Pereira & William Bialek (1999)
"The Information Bottleneck Method" - arXiv:physics/0004057

Key Functions:
- transform(): Convert new data to IB representation space
- predict(): Make optimal predictions through the bottleneck
- get_cluster_centers(): Extract learned cluster information

🔬 Mathematical Foundation:
This implements the extension problem from IB theory - how to apply the learned
optimal representation p*(z|x) to new, unseen data while maintaining the
information-theoretic properties and guarantees.

        🔍 Nearest Neighbor IB Extension - Robust Local Method
        ======================================================
        
        This method extends IB representations using local neighborhood averaging.
        It finds the k most similar training samples and combines their learned
        representations using inverse distance weighting.
        
        🧮 Mathematical Foundation:
        ==========================
        p(z|x_new) = Σ_{i∈NN(x_new)} w_i * p(z|x_i)
        
        Where:
        - NN(x_new) = k nearest neighbors of x_new in training set
        - w_i = 1/(d_i + ε) normalized, d_i = ||x_new - x_i||
        - ε = small constant preventing division by zero
        
        🎯 Key Advantages:
        ==================
        • Robust to distribution shift and outliers
        • Adapts locally to neighborhood patterns
        • No assumptions about global data structure
        • Graceful degradation when training data is limited
        • Works without any external dependencies
        
        🔍 Implementation Strategy:
        ===========================
        • Uses sklearn NearestNeighbors if available (fast)
        • Falls back to manual distance computation if needed
        • Inverse distance weighting for smooth interpolation
        • Automatic fallback to prior distribution for edge cases

        • Small training datasets
        • When other methods are unavailable
        • Robust baseline that always works

        🎯 Make Optimal Predictions Through the Information Bottleneck!
        ===============================================================
        
        🎯 ELI5: Use your trained smart filter to make predictions on new data! 
        First, the filter compresses the new data to keep only relevant information, 
        then uses that compressed form to make the best possible predictions.
        
        🔬 Mathematical Foundation:
        ===========================
        Implements the optimal Bayesian prediction from Tishby 1999:
        
        P(y|x_new) = Σ_z P(y|z) · P(z|x_new)
        
        This is provably optimal under the Information Bottleneck principle!
        
        🎨 Two-Step Process:
        ===================
        
        Step 1: COMPRESS 🔄
        ─────────────────────
        • Transform x_new → z using learned encoder p(z|x)
        • Keep only information relevant for prediction
        • Filter out noise and irrelevant details
        
        Step 2: PREDICT 🎯  
        ────────────────────
        • Apply learned decoder p(y|z) to compressed representation
        • Get optimal prediction based on compressed information
        • Return most likely class/value
        
        🧮 Information Flow:
        ===================
        
            Input X_new ──→ [ENCODER] ──→ Z_repr ──→ [DECODER] ──→ Predictions
            (Raw Data)      p(z|x_new)    (Optimal    p(y|z)        (Optimal)
                                         Compress.)                 
        
        📊 Parameters:
        ==============
        Args:
            X (np.ndarray): 🔍 New data to predict on (n_samples, n_features)
                • Must have same feature structure as training data
                • Can be single sample or batch of samples
                • Gets automatically preprocessed using training statistics
        
        Returns:
            np.ndarray: 🏆 Predicted class labels (n_samples,)
                • For classification: Integer class labels [0, 1, 2, ...]
                • Represents most likely class for each sample
                • Based on maximum probability: argmax P(y|x_new)
        
        🔍 What Happens Under the Hood:
        ===============================
        
        1. **Validation**: ✅ Check that model was trained
        2. **Transform**: 🔄 Get IB representation Z = transform(X)  
        3. **Prediction**: 🎯 Multiply Z @ decoder to get P(y|x)
        4. **Decision**: 🏆 Return argmax for most likely class
        
        💡 Pro Usage Tips:
        ==================
        • For probability distributions instead of class labels, use:
          `probs = ib.transform(X) @ ib.p_y_given_z`
        • For confidence estimates, examine the max probability value
        • For multi-class problems, all classes handled automatically
        • For regression, consider discretizing targets during training
        
        🎯 Why This Is Optimal:
        =======================
        1. **Information Theory**: Uses only relevant information for prediction
        2. **Noise Robustness**: Compressed representation filters out noise  
        3. **Generalization**: Prevents overfitting through principled compression
        4. **Theoretical Guarantees**: Provably optimal under IB objective

        📍 Extract Cluster Center Information from Learned IB Model
        ==========================================================
        
        This method computes the cluster centers in the original feature space
        based on the learned IB representation. Each cluster center represents
        the "typical" or "prototype" input that belongs to that cluster.
        
        🧮 Mathematical Foundation:
        ==========================
        For each cluster k, the center is computed as:
        
        c_k = Σ_i p(z=k|x_i) * x_i / Σ_i p(z=k|x_i)
        
        This is a weighted average where each training sample x_i contributes
        to cluster k proportionally to its membership probability p(z=k|x_i).
        
        🔍 What This Tells You:
        =======================
        • **Cluster Prototypes**: What does a "typical" member of each cluster look like?
        • **Feature Importance**: Which features distinguish different clusters?
        • **Data Structure**: How is the learned representation organized in input space?
        • **Interpretability**: Can help understand what each cluster represents
        
        🎯 Use Cases:
        =============
        • **Visualization**: Plot cluster centers to understand data structure
        • **Interpretation**: Analyze what features define each information cluster
        • **Quality Check**: Verify that clusters make semantic sense
        • **Debugging**: Identify potential issues with cluster assignments
        
        Returns:
            np.ndarray: 📊 Cluster centers matrix (n_clusters, n_features)
                • Row k contains the center of cluster k in feature space
                • Each center is a weighted average of training samples
                • Can be used for visualization and interpretation
        
        Raises:
            ValueError: If model hasn't been trained yet (no training data available)
