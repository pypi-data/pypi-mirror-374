🎯 ELI5 Summary:
Think of this like a control panel for our algorithm! Just like how your TV remote 
has different buttons for volume, channels, and brightness, this file has all the settings 
that control how our AI algorithm behaves. Researchers can adjust these settings to get 
the best results for their specific problem.
