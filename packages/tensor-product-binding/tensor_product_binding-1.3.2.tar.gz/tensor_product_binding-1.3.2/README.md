# Tensor Product Binding

üß† Neural binding mechanisms for structured knowledge representation in connectionist systems

**Smolensky, P. (1990)** - "Tensor product variable binding and the representation of symbolic structures in connectionist systems"  
**Smolensky, P., & Legendre, G. (2006)** - "The harmonic mind: From neural computation to optimality-theoretic grammar"

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install tensor-product-binding
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Tensor Product Binding
```python
from tensor_product_binding import TensorProductBinding
import numpy as np

# Create tensor product binding system
tpb = TensorProductBinding(
    role_dimension=64,
    filler_dimension=64,
    binding_type='outer_product'
)

# Create role and filler vectors
agent_role = tpb.create_role_vector("agent")
patient_role = tpb.create_role_vector("patient")
john_filler = tpb.create_filler_vector("john")
mary_filler = tpb.create_filler_vector("mary")

# Bind roles to fillers
john_as_agent = tpb.bind(agent_role, john_filler)
mary_as_patient = tpb.bind(patient_role, mary_filler)

# Compose complex structure: "john loves mary"
sentence_structure = tpb.compose([john_as_agent, mary_as_patient])

# Extract bindings
extracted_agent = tpb.unbind(sentence_structure, agent_role)
similarity = tpb.similarity(extracted_agent, john_filler)
print(f"Agent extraction similarity: {similarity:.3f}")
```

### Compositional Semantics Example
```python
from tensor_product_binding import CompositionalSemantics

# Create compositional semantic system
semantics = CompositionalSemantics(
    vector_dimension=512,
    composition_method='smolensky',
    role_scheme='syntactic'
)

# Define semantic roles
roles = {
    'subject': semantics.create_role("subject"),
    'verb': semantics.create_role("verb"), 
    'object': semantics.create_role("object")
}

# Create semantic representations
concepts = {
    'john': semantics.create_concept("john", category="person"),
    'loves': semantics.create_concept("loves", category="relation"),
    'mary': semantics.create_concept("mary", category="person")
}

# Compose sentence meaning
sentence_meaning = semantics.compose_proposition(
    subject=concepts['john'],
    verb=concepts['loves'],
    object=concepts['mary']
)

# Query the composed structure
who_loves = semantics.query(sentence_meaning, roles['subject'])
print(f"Who loves? {semantics.decode(who_loves)}")

loves_whom = semantics.query(sentence_meaning, roles['object']) 
print(f"Loves whom? {semantics.decode(loves_whom)}")
```

### Neural Binding with Hierarchical Structures
```python
from tensor_product_binding import NeuralBinding

# Create hierarchical binding system
neural_binding = NeuralBinding(
    base_dimension=256,
    hierarchy_levels=3,
    binding_strength=0.8
)

# Build complex hierarchical structure
# Sentence: "The cat [that chased the mouse] ran home"
sentence = neural_binding.create_structure()

# Main clause
main_subject = neural_binding.bind("subject", "cat")
main_verb = neural_binding.bind("verb", "ran")
main_object = neural_binding.bind("object", "home")

# Embedded relative clause  
rel_subject = neural_binding.bind("rel_subject", "cat")
rel_verb = neural_binding.bind("rel_verb", "chased")
rel_object = neural_binding.bind("rel_object", "mouse")

# Compose relative clause
relative_clause = neural_binding.compose([rel_subject, rel_verb, rel_object])

# Bind relative clause as modifier
modified_subject = neural_binding.bind("modifier", relative_clause)
final_subject = neural_binding.compose([main_subject, modified_subject])

# Complete sentence structure
complete_sentence = neural_binding.compose([
    final_subject, main_verb, main_object
])

# Navigate the hierarchical structure
print(f"Main verb: {neural_binding.extract(complete_sentence, 'verb')}")
embedded_clause = neural_binding.extract(final_subject, "modifier")
embedded_verb = neural_binding.extract(embedded_clause, "rel_verb")
print(f"Embedded verb: {embedded_verb}")
```

## üß¨ Advanced Features

### Symbolic Structure Handling
```python
from tensor_product_binding import SymbolicStructures

# Handle complex symbolic structures
symbolic = SymbolicStructures(
    representation='tree_structure',
    binding_method='recursive'
)

# Parse and represent nested structure
# Expression: "(+ (* 3 4) (/ 8 2))"
expression = symbolic.parse_expression("(+ (* 3 4) (/ 8 2))")
tensor_repr = symbolic.tensorize(expression)

# Manipulate symbolic structure
left_subtree = symbolic.get_subtree(tensor_repr, path="left")
operator = symbolic.get_operator(left_subtree)
print(f"Left operator: {operator}")  # Should be "*"

# Transform structure
simplified = symbolic.apply_transformation(tensor_repr, "arithmetic_simplify")
result = symbolic.evaluate(simplified)
print(f"Result: {result}")  # Should be 16
```

### Pattern Completion and Analogy
```python
from tensor_product_binding import PatternCompletion

# Pattern completion using tensor product representations
pattern = PatternCompletion(
    dimension=400,
    completion_method='hopfield',
    noise_tolerance=0.2
)

# Learn analogical patterns
# "man is to woman as king is to ?"
man = pattern.encode("man")
woman = pattern.encode("woman")
king = pattern.encode("king")

# Create analogical relationship vector
relationship = pattern.subtract(woman, man)  # woman - man
queen_predicted = pattern.add(king, relationship)  # king + relationship

# Find closest match
candidates = ["queen", "prince", "castle", "crown"]
matches = pattern.find_nearest(queen_predicted, candidates)
print(f"Best analogy completion: {matches[0]}")  # Should be "queen"
```

## üî¨ Key Algorithmic Features

### Tensor Product Operations
- **Role-Filler Binding**: Systematic binding of roles to filler values
- **Compositional Structure**: Hierarchical composition of complex representations
- **Unbinding Operations**: Extraction of components from composite structures
- **Distributed Representation**: Graceful degradation and similarity-based processing

### Neural Plausibility
- **Connectionist Compatibility**: Designed for neural network implementation
- **Parallel Processing**: Simultaneous constraint satisfaction
- **Noise Tolerance**: Robust performance with imperfect inputs
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles structures of varying complexity

### Compositional Semantics
- **Systematic Composition**: Predictable meaning combination
- **Productivity**: Generate infinite structures from finite components
- **Systematicity**: Similar structures have similar representations
- **Recursion Support**: Handle arbitrarily nested structures

## üìä Implementation Highlights

- **Research Accuracy**: Faithful implementation of Smolensky's theoretical framework
- **Educational Value**: Clear code structure for learning tensor product representations
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient tensor operations using NumPy/SciPy
- **Modular Design**: Separate components for different aspects of binding
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy to extend for domain-specific applications

## üßÆ Theoretical Foundation

This implementation provides research-accurate implementations of:

- **Tensor Product Representations**: Smolensky's foundational framework for symbolic structures in neural networks
- **Compositional Semantics**: Systematic meaning composition in distributed representations  
- **Neural Binding Theory**: Mechanisms for dynamic variable binding in connectionist systems
- **Harmonic Grammar**: Integration with optimality-theoretic approaches to cognitive modeling

### Core Mathematical Operations

**Binding Operation:**
```
bind(role, filler) = role ‚äó filler
```

**Composition Operation:**  
```
compose(bindings) = Œ£·µ¢ binding·µ¢
```

**Unbinding Operation:**
```
unbind(structure, role) = structure ¬∑ role‚Ä† 
```

Where `‚äó` is the tensor product, `¬∑` is the dot product, and `‚Ä†` indicates the role conjugate.
