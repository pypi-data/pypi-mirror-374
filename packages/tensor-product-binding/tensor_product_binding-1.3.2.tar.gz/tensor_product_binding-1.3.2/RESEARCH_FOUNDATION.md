# Research Foundation: Tensor Product Binding

## Academic Origins

This implementation is based on foundational research in cognitive science and neural computation, particularly the work of Paul Smolensky on tensor product representations for symbolic structures in connectionist systems.

## Implementation Details

### Tensor Product Operations
The core binding mechanism uses tensor products to combine role and filler vectors:
```
binding(role, filler) = role âŠ— filler
```

### Compositional Structure
Implements systematic composition following Smolensky's framework:
- Role-filler bindings for hierarchical structures
- Tensor product composition for complex representations
- Unbinding operations for structure extraction

### Neural Plausibility
Based on principles of neural computation:
- Distributed representations
- Graceful degradation
- Similarity-based processing
- Parallel constraint satisfaction

This implementation maintains fidelity to the theoretical foundations while providing practical tools for neural symbolic computation.
