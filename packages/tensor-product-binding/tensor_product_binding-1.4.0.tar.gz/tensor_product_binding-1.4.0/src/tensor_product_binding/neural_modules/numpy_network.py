        🔗 Bind roles and fillers using tensor product - Create compositional structures!
        
        🎯 ELI5 EXPLANATION:
        ==================
        Think of binding like creating a magical filing system where you can store 
        relationships between concepts!
        
        Imagine you want to remember "John LOVES Pizza" and "Sarah HATES Broccoli". 
        The binding operation creates a special mathematical combination that stores:
        • ROLE: "John" (who is doing the action)  
        • FILLER: "Pizza" (what the action is about)
        • RELATIONSHIP: "LOVES" (stored in the binding structure)
        
        The tensor product binding:
        • 🎭 **Roles**: Who or what is performing (subjects, relations)
        • 🎯 **Fillers**: What they're connected to (objects, values)
        • 🔗 **Binding**: Mathematical operation that preserves both
        • 📊 **Result**: Compositional representation you can query later!
        
        🔬 RESEARCH FOUNDATION:
        ======================
        Implements Smolensky (1990) Tensor Product Variable Binding:
        "Representation of role-filler bindings using outer product operation"
        
        Mathematical operation: B = R ⊗ F (outer product)
        where R is role vector, F is filler vector, B is bound representation
        
        Based on foundational papers:
        - Smolensky, P. (1990): "Tensor Product Variable Binding"
        - Gayler, R.W. (2003): "Vector Symbolic Architectures"
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        roles : np.ndarray, shape (batch_size, vector_dim)
            🎭 Role vectors representing structural positions or relations.
            Each row is a distributed representation of a role (like "subject", "verb").
            
        fillers : np.ndarray, shape (batch_size, vector_dim)
            🎯 Filler vectors representing content that fills the roles.
            Each row is a distributed representation of content (like "John", "loves").
            
        Returns
        -------
        bound_representation : np.ndarray, shape (batch_size, vector_dim, vector_dim)
            🔗 Tensor product binding of roles and fillers.
            Each matrix [i,:,:] stores the compositional structure for sample i.
            Can be queried later using unbind() to retrieve fillers from roles.

        🔓 Unbind to retrieve fillers from bound representations - Query compositional memory!
        
        🎯 ELI5 EXPLANATION:
        ==================
        Think of unbinding like having a magical query system for your filing cabinet!
        
        After you've stored "John LOVES Pizza" using bind(), you can now ask questions like:
        • "Who LOVES pizza?" → Query with "LOVES" role → Get back "John"
        • "What does John do?" → Query with "John" role → Get back "LOVES"  
        • "What does John love?" → Query with "John+LOVES" → Get back "Pizza"
        
        The unbinding operation:
        • 🔍 **Query**: Which role are you asking about?
        • 🔗 **Bound Structure**: The compositional representation from bind()
        • 🧠 **Processing**: Mathematical extraction using tensor operations
        • 📊 **Result**: The filler that was originally bound to that role!
        
        🔬 RESEARCH FOUNDATION:
        ======================
        Implements the inverse of Smolensky (1990) Tensor Product Binding:
        "Retrieval of fillers from role-filler bindings using matrix operations"
        
        Mathematical operation: F' = B ⋅ R (matrix-vector product)
        where B is bound representation, R is query role, F' is retrieved filler
        
        This enables compositional querying of structured representations,
        allowing retrieval of specific information from complex structures.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        bound_representation : np.ndarray, shape (batch_size, vector_dim, vector_dim)
            🔗 Tensor product representations created by bind() operation.
            Each matrix contains compositional structure that can be queried.
            
        query_role : np.ndarray, shape (batch_size, vector_dim) or (vector_dim,)
            🔍 Role vector(s) to query against the bound representations.
            This specifies which information you want to retrieve.
            
        Returns
        -------
        retrieved_fillers : np.ndarray, shape (batch_size, vector_dim)
            🎯 Filler vectors retrieved from the bound representations.
            These should approximate the original fillers that were bound to the query roles.
