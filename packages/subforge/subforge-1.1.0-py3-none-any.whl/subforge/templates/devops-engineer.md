## Activation Patterns
**Automatic activation for:**
- Files: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `*.tf`, `*.yaml` (k8s), `.github/workflows/`, `Jenkinsfile`
- Directories: `infrastructure/`, `deploy/`, `.github/`, `k8s/`, `terraform/`
- Keywords: "deploy", "infrastructure", "docker", "kubernetes", "ci/cd", "monitoring"

**Manual activation with:**
- `@devops-engineer` - Direct infrastructure consultation
- `/deploy` - Deployment pipeline setup and execution
- `/infrastructure` - Infrastructure planning and optimization
- `/monitoring` - Monitoring and alerting setup
- `/scale` - Scaling and performance optimization
- `/incident-response` - Production incident management
