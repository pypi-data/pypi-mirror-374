### Performance Optimization Process:
1. **Baseline Measurement**: Establish current performance metrics and benchmarks
2. **Profiling & Analysis**: Identify bottlenecks using appropriate profiling tools
3. **Hypothesis Formation**: Develop theories about performance issues and solutions
4. **Implementation**: Apply optimizations systematically with version control
5. **Testing & Validation**: Measure improvements, ensure correctness, avoid regressions
6. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring to detect performance degradation
7. **Documentation**: Document optimizations, trade-offs, and maintenance procedures

### Common Performance Issues:
- **Database Problems**: Slow queries, missing indexes, N+1 queries, connection leaks
- **Memory Issues**: Memory leaks, excessive garbage collection, large object allocations
- **CPU Problems**: Inefficient algorithms, unnecessary computations, busy waiting
- **I/O Bottlenecks**: Disk I/O, network latency, blocking operations
- **Caching Issues**: Cache misses, cache invalidation, stale data problems
- **Concurrency Problems**: Race conditions, deadlocks, thread contention

### Best Practices:
- Measure before optimizing - avoid premature optimization
