# Tutorial


In this tutorial we will walk through the basics of creating a 1D model input from a 2D model.

To use , we need at least two input files:

-   `2DMapOutput`
-   `CrossSectionLocationFile`

in this tutorial we will use the test data bundled with the package. You
will find this in the source directory:

``` text
# 2DMapOutput
tests\test_data\cases\case_02_compound\Data\2DModelOutput\FlowFM_map.nc 
# CrossSectionLocationFile
tests\test_data\cases\case_02_compound\Data\cross_section_locations.xyz  
```

This case is a simple 2D compound channel model.

## Create a new project

To start a new project:

=== "Python"

    ``` python
    from fm2prof.IniFile import IniFile

    inifile = IniFile().print_configuration()
    ini_path = f"MyProject.ini"

    with open(ini_path, "w") as f:
        f.write(inifile)
    
    ```

=== "CLI"

    ``` bash
    FM2PROF create MyProject
    ```


This will create a valid configuration file with all parameters set to their default values. 

## Modify the input

For the purpose of this tutorial, move the 2D model simulation file to
[input]{.title-ref}. This is not a requirement - you can refer to any
location on your pc.

Open the configuration file with your favorite text editor and change
the following two settings to your input data:

``` text
[input]
2DMapOutput                   =         # Output file from FM2D model (.net file)
CrossSectionLocationFile      =           # .csv or .txt file (, as delimiter) that contains four columns: X_coordinate,Y_coordinate,BranchName,Length,Chainage.
```

To be sure you used the correct data, run:


=== "Python"

    ``` python
    from fm2prof import Project
    
    project = Project("MyProject.ini")
    
    ```

=== "CLI"

    ``` bash
    FM2PROF check MyProject
    ```



Study the output. Errors indicate that something is wrong with your
input. In that case, you will need to correct the configurationfile.

## Run FM2PROF

You should also see a print-out of the configuration file. These are the
settings that will be used and can be altered using a config file. The
configuration file does not need all parameters to be specified. If a
parameter is not in the configuration file, default values will be used.

The following examples run FM2PROF, overwrite any existing results and
produce figures of the generated cross-sections. 

=== "Python"

    ``` python
    from fm2prof import Project
    from fm2prof.utils import VisualiseOutput
    
    # load project
    project = Project("MyProject.ini")
    
    # overwrite = True overwrites any existing output
    project.run(overwrite=True)
    
    # to visualize cross-sectino putput:
    vis = VisualiseOutput(
                project.get_output_directory(), 
                logger=project.get_logger()
            )

    for css in vis.cross_sections:
        vis.figure_cross_section(css)
    
    ```

=== "CLI"

    ``` bash
    FM2PROF run MyProject -o -p
    ```



All `outputFiles` are written to the `output` directory specified in the FM2PROF configuration file. 

After generating output it is important to check whether everything went
well. See the following links to learn more about available tools:
