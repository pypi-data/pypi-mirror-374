A-B Background subtraction
==========================

.. note:: 
    This procedure can only be performed if you have several frames of the same object,
    taken continuously one after another, with the same exposure time, but where the 
    objects' spatial position is with purpose shifted slightly on the detector. **Skip this procedure if you do not have
    such frames.**

Quickstart
-----------

The procedure is called by the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pylongslit_subtract_background PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE

The procedure will perform A-B background subtraction for the pairs of reduced
files as provided in the configuration file. The procedure will alter the 
reduced files in-place.

Quality Assesment
------------------

The procedure will show the frame prior and after background subtraction. An example for
the SDSS_J213510+2728 dataset is shown below:

.. image:: pictures/good_ab.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

Besides a clear reduction of the sky-background, the most important thing to ensure is that the object from the B frame (the negative) is
not laying too close to the object in the A frame (the positive), such so some of the 
A object signal is subtracted by the B object signal. The software takes a 
sample of 1d-slices to help investigate this:

.. image:: pictures/whole_AB_slice.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

Zooming on the the negative and positive object signal, you can see that they 
are not overlapping:

.. image:: pictures/good_AB_slice.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center


The GQ1218+0832 tutorial dataset shows an example where the traces are overlapping:

.. image:: pictures/bad_AB_slice.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

Hence, **you should not perform A-B subtraction on this dataset**. Even though 
the traces seem to be just touching, the subtraction will still remove some of the
object signal.



If this is the case, reset 
(perform the :ref:`reduction procedure <reduce>` again) and move on to the next 
step without A-B subtraction.

Parameter options
------------------

The parameters for this procedure are providing the pairs of reduced files that should be
subtracted from each other. Example from the SDSS_J213510+2728 dataset:

.. code:: 

    "background_sub" : {
        "pairs": {
            "1": {
                "A": "ALHh080251.fits",
                "B": "ALHh080252.fits"
            },
            "2": {
                "A": "ALHh080252.fits",
                "B": "ALHh080251.fits"
            }
        }
    }

You can insert any number of pairs, as long as they are tagged with numbers (in string format)
starting from 1 and increasing by 1 for each pair (1,2,3...). This helps the software
to keep track of the pairs. The A and B files should be the filenames of the reduced files 
(their raw filenames).

.. note:: 
    If the frames are taken with the telescope pointing far down from zenith, the
    airmass (and thereby instensity of the sky background) can change significantly
    between even subsequent frames. In this case, one of the subtracted frames will have a non-negligible
    negative sky background, and the other a non-negligible positive sky background. In principle, 
    this effect will even out when :ref:`combinning the fluxed spectra <combine_spec>`, but
    this might still cause issues in the pipeline steps in-between the A-B subtraction
    and the combination. If you have frames with high airmass, you might 
    want to consider deploying the :ref:`modelled sky background subtraction <sky>`
    only. What is best to do can always be determined by trial and error.

For users new to data reduction - short introduction to A-B background subtraction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A-B background subtraction is a technique used to remove the sky-background from
spectra. The idea is to take two frames of the same object, with the same exposure time,
but where the object is shifted slightly on the detector. This way, the sky gets recorded 
in the spatial position of the object. Example: if for frame A the object is
at spatial pixel 100, the object can be moved to spatial pixel 110 for the frame B, and 
now frame B has the sky background recorded at spatial pixel 100. Subtracting frame B from frame A
will remove the sky-background from the object signal. The procedure is called A-B subtraction.

For users new to data reduction - short introduction to sky background
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sky background is the light from the sky and the atmosphere that is recorded by the detector together
with the object spectrum. This background light covers
the whole slit, and the bacground therefore shows itself as lines through the whole spatial direction
(see above figures). The sky background consists both of strong sky lines (emission lines from the sky) and 
a continuum background. These sky lines/background are mixed into the object signal, and must be removed.
