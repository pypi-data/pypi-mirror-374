## Features

- Generate randomized tight-binding band structures — or import your own  
- Compute spectral functions, including Fermi-liquid and electron-boson kink-like self-energies  
- Add experimental effects: offset angles, rotations, flake domains, background, and detector sensitivities  
- Simulate ARPES spectra statistically across many electron events  

## Installation

You can install `aurelia` directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install aurelia
```
## Usage

See the [examples](examples/) folder for sample scripts to get started.
