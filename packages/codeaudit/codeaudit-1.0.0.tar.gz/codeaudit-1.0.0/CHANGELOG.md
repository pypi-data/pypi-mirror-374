# Change Log

## Version 1.0

This release represents a stabilisation of Python Code Audit!
Main changes in relation to the pre-1.0 versions are:
* More validations added: Python Code Audit now counts 70 security validations!
* Documentation updates
* Improved validation for `builtins`, like `compile`, `exec`,, `eval` that can be obfuscated in code. 
* Various UI/UX updates. CLI text improved and HTML report text made consistent. 
* Added test to validate correct working for now and in the future. Also validated working with other SAST tools to make sure core functionality is rock solid or better! Spoiler Python Code Audit is better than most used OSS and commercial SAST tools available today!


## Beta Versions (Before 1.0)

All published beta version are stable and verified!
During the public beta phase input of users and experts is retrieved. 
This resulted is mainly:
* More validation
* Better documentation and
* UI/UX improvements to make sure Python Code Audit is dead simple to use for non-programmers to validate a Python package.
