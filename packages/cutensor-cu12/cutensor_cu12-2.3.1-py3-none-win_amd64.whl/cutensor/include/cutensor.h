 * \mainpage cuTENSOR: A High-Performance CUDA Library for Tensor Primitives
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * \subsection nomen Nomenclature
 *
 * The term tensor refers to an \b order-n (a.k.a.,
 * n-dimensional) array. One can think of tensors as a generalization of
 * matrices to higher \b orders.

 * For example, scalars, vectors, and matrices are
 * order-0, order-1, and order-2 tensors, respectively.
 *
 * An order-n tensor has n \b modes. Each mode has an \b extent (a.k.a. size).
 * Each mode you can specify a \b stride s > 0. This \b stride
 * describes offset of two logically consecutive elements in physical (i.e., linearized) memory.
 * This is similar to the leading-dimension in BLAS.

 * cuTENSOR, by default, adheres to a generalized \b column-major data layout.
 * For example: \f$A_{a,b,c} \in {R}^{4\times 8 \times 12}\f$
 * is an order-3 tensor with the extent of the a-mode, b-mode, and c-mode
 * respectively being 4, 8, and 12. If not explicitly specified, the strides are
 * assumed to be: stride(a) = 1, stride(b) = extent(a), stride(c) = extent(a) *
 * extent(b).

 * For a general order-n tensor \f$A_{i_1,i_2,...,i_n}\f$ we require that the strides do
 * not lead to overlapping memory accesses; for instance, \f$stride(i_1) \geq 1\f$, and
 * \f$stride(i_l) \geq stride(i_{l-1}) * extent(i_{l-1})\f$.

 * We say that a tensor is \b packed if it is contiguously stored in memory along all
 * modes. That is, \f$ stride(i_1) = 1\f$ and \f$stride(i_l) =stride(i_{l-1}) *
 * extent(i_{l-1})\f$).
 *
 * \subsection einsum Einstein Notation
 * We adhere to the "Einstein notation": Modes that appear in the input
 * tensors, and that do not appear in the output tensor, are implicitly
 * contracted.

/**
 * \brief Initializes the cuTENSOR library and allocates the memory for the library context.
 *
 * \details The device associated with a particular cuTENSOR handle is assumed to remain
 * unchanged after the \ref cutensorCreate call. In order for the cuTENSOR library to
 * use a different device, the application must set the new device to be used by
 * calling cudaSetDevice and then create another cuTENSOR handle, which will
 * be associated with the new device, by calling \ref cutensorCreate. 
 *
 * Moreover, each handle by default has a plan cache that can store the least recently
 * used \ref cutensorPlan_t; its default capacity is 64, but it can be changed via \ref
 * cutensorHandleResizePlanCache if this is too little storage space.
 * See the <a href="../plan_cache.html">Plan Cache Guide</a> for more information.
 *
 * The user is responsible for calling  \ref cutensorDestroy to free the resources associated
 * with the handle.

/**
 * \brief This function creates an operation descriptor that encodes an elementwise trinary operation.
 *
 * \details Said trinary operation has the following general form:
 * \f[ D_{\Pi^C(i_0,i_1,...,i_n)} = \Phi_{ABC}(\Phi_{AB}(\alpha op_A(A_{\Pi^A(i_0,i_1,...,i_n)}), \beta op_B(B_{\Pi^B(i_0,i_1,...,i_n)})), \gamma op_C(C_{\Pi^C(i_0,i_1,...,i_n)})) \f]
 *
 * Where
 *    - A,B,C,D are multi-mode tensors (of arbitrary data types).
 *    - \f$\Pi^A, \Pi^B, \Pi^C \f$ are permutation operators that permute the modes of A, B, and C respectively.
 *    - \f$op_{A},op_{B},op_{C}\f$ are unary element-wise operators (e.g., IDENTITY, CONJUGATE).
 *    - \f$\Phi_{ABC}, \Phi_{AB}\f$ are binary element-wise operators (e.g., ADD, MUL, MAX, MIN).
 *
 * Notice that the broadcasting (of a mode) can be achieved by simply omitting that mode from the respective tensor.
 *
 * Moreover, modes may appear in any order, giving users a greater flexibility. The only <b>restrictions</b> are:
 *    - modes that appear in A or B _must_ also appear in the output tensor; a mode that only appears in the input would be contracted and such an operation would be covered by either \ref cutensorContract or \ref cutensorReduce.
 *    - each mode may appear in each tensor at most once.
 *
 * Input tensors may be read even if the value
 * of the corresponding scalar is zero.
 *
 * Examples:
 *    - \f$ D_{a,b,c,d} = A_{b,d,a,c}\f$
 *    - \f$ D_{a,b,c,d} = 2.2 * A_{b,d,a,c} + 1.3 * B_{c,b,d,a}\f$
 *    - \f$ D_{a,b,c,d} = 2.2 * A_{b,d,a,c} + 1.3 * B_{c,b,d,a} + C_{a,b,c,d}\f$
 *    - \f$ D_{a,b,c,d} = min((2.2 * A_{b,d,a,c} + 1.3 * B_{c,b,d,a}), C_{a,b,c,d})\f$
 *
 * Call \ref cutensorElementwiseTrinaryExecute to perform the actual operation.
 *
 * Please use \ref cutensorDestroyOperationDescriptor to deallocated the descriptor once it is no longer used.

/**
 * \brief This function creates an operation descriptor for a tensor permutation.
 *
 * \details The tensor permutation has the following general form:
 * \f[ B_{\Pi^B(i_0,i_1,...,i_n)} = \alpha op_A(A_{\Pi^A(i_0,i_1,...,i_n)}) \f]
 *
 * Consequently, this function performs an out-of-place tensor permutation and is a specialization of \ref cutensorCreateElementwiseBinary.
 *
 * Where
 *    - A and B are multi-mode tensors (of arbitrary data types),
 *    - \f$\Pi^A, \Pi^B\f$ are permutation operators that permute the modes of A, B respectively,
 *    - \f$op_A\f$ is an unary element-wise operators (e.g., IDENTITY, SQR, CONJUGATE), and
 *    - \f$\Psi\f$ is specified in the tensor descriptor descA.
 *
 * Broadcasting (of a mode) can be achieved by simply omitting that mode from the respective tensor.
 *
 * Modes may appear in any order. The only <b>restrictions</b> are:
 *    - modes that appear in A _must_ also appear in the output tensor.
 *    - each mode may appear in each tensor at most once.
 *
 * Supported data-type combinations are:

 * PUBLIC BETA: Block-sparse tensor contractions. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
 *
 * cuTENSOR's block-sparse functionality is a public beta feature. The current
 * block-sparse backend is not as feature-rich as cuTENSOR's dense counterpart 
 * (e.g., only support a limited set of data types, no conjugate support, only 
 * tensors up to 8D) and we are aware of some performance improvements that we 
 * are planning to provide as part of follow-up releases. While we intend to 
 * keep the API stable from one release to the next, we cannot guarantee this 
 * at this point due to the experimental nature of this API.
 *
 * We would much appreciate your feedback to guide this development process and
 * steer these future optimizations in the right direction.
 */

/**
 * \brief Create a block-sparse tensor descriptor
 *
 * \details A block-sparse tensor descriptor fully specifies the data layout of a 
 *  block-sparse tensor (currently limited to up to 8 modes).
 *
 * Let us consider an example for a block-sparse tensor of order 2, i.e.,
 * a block-sparse matrix `A`.  Its first mode (`rows`) is subdivided
 * into 5 sections (with extents 4, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively), and its 
 * second mode (`columns`) is subdivided into 3 sections 
 * (with extents 2, 3, 7). The matrix has 8 non-zero blocks:
 *
 * \verbatim embed:rst:leading-asterisk
 * +-------+-------+-------+
 * | 4 x 2 |       | 4 x 7 |
 * +-------+-------+-------+
 * |       | 2 x 3 |       |
 * +-------+-------+-------+
 * |       | 3 x 3 | 3 x 7 |
 * +-------+-------+-------+
 * | 4 x 2 |       |       |
 * +-------+-------+-------+
 * |       | 5 x 3 | 5 x 7 |
 * +-------+-------+-------+
 * \endverbatim
 * 
 * Notice that we require the same extent of each sub section across the entire mode, i.e., 
 * every block within the same section of a mode has the same extent. For example, in the
 * above picture every block on the right has 7 colums, and all blocks on the bottom 
 * have 5 rows.
 *
 * Moreover, we only store the non-zero blocks (blocks that are zero are left blank in
 * the above representation).
 *
 * To be precise, the above block-sparse tensor could be created via:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * uint32_t numModes = 2;
 * uint64_t numNonZeroBlocks = 8;
 * const uint32_t sectionsPerMode[] = {5, 3}; // Array of size numModes
 * const int64_t extent[] =                   // Array of size Sum(sectionsPerMode)
 * {
 *      4, 2, 3, 4, 5, // extents of sections of first  mode
 *      2, 3, 7        // extents of sections of second mode
 * };
 *
 * const int32_t nonZeroCoordinates[] = // Array of size numModes x numNonZeroBlocks
 * {
 *      0, 0, // Block 0.     List of non-zero blocks in the block-sparse tensor.
 *      3, 0, // Block 1.     Blocks may be listed in an arbitrary order, however,
 *      1, 1, // Block 2.     this order must remain the same for every subsequent 
 *      2, 1, // Block 3.     operation.
 *      4, 1, // Block 4.     For example, when calling cutensorBlockSparseContract,
 *      0, 2, // Block 5.     pointers to the blocks need to be given in this order.
 *      2, 2, // Block 6.     The strides of the blocks in the stride[] array also     
 *      4, 2  // Block 7.     need to be given the same order as in this list. 
 * };
 *      ^  ^
 *      |  |
 *      |  \--- Section number of second mode,  block-column number
 *      \------ Section number of first  mode,  block-row number
 *
 *
 * const int64_t stride[] = // Either nullptr or an array of size numModes x numNonZeroBlocks
 * {
 *      1, 4,  // Block 0.   Strides for each block, given in the same order as in
 *      1, 4,  // Block 1.   the array nonZeroCoordinates.  
 *      1, 2,  // Block 2.   
 *      1, 3,  // Block 3.   In this example, each block is stored contiguously in
 *      1, 5,  // Block 4.   column-major order; this is equivalent to passing stride=nullptr.
 *      1, 4,  // Block 5.   
 *      1, 3,  // Block 6.   However, other memory layouts are also allowed, see documentation
 *      1, 5   // Block 7.   below.
 * };
 *
 * cudaDataType_t dataType = CUDA_C_64F; // For example: complex-valued double-precision.
 * \endcode
 *
 * \param[in] handle The library handle.
 * \param[out] desc The resulting block-sparse tensor descriptor.
 * \param[in] numModes The number of modes. Currently, a maximum of 8 modes is supported.
 * \param[in] numNonZeroBlocks The number of non-zero blocks in the block-sparse tensor.
 * \param[in] numSectionsePerMode The number of sections of each mode (host array of size `numModes`).
 * \param[in] extent The extents of the sections of each mode (host array of size `\sum_i^numModes(numSectionsPerMode[i])`).
 *            First come the extents of the sections of the first mode, then the extents of the sections of the second mode, and so forth.
 * \param[in] nonZeroCoordinates Block-coordinates of each non-zero block (host array of size `numModes` x `numNonZeroBlocks`
 *            Blocks can be specified in any order, however, that order must be consistent with stride and alignmentRequirement arrays.            
 * \param[in] stride The strides of each dense block (either nullptr or a host array of size `numModes` x `numNonZeroBlocks`). 
 *            First the strides of the first block, then the strides of the second block, with the blocks in the same order as in
 *            nonZeroCoordinates. Passing nullptr means contiguous column-major order for each block.
 *            Moreover, the strides need to be compatible in the following sense: Suppose you sort the strides of the first block, such
 *            that they are ascending; this sorting results in a permutation. If you apply this 
 *            permutation to the strides of any other block, the result needs to be sorted as well.
 *
 *            As an example:
 *             - strides of block #0: 5, 1, 10, 20. Sorted strides would be: 1, 5, 10, 20.
 *               The permutation to sort the strides in this case is to swap the first two elements.
 *             - strides of block #1: 10, 1, 30, 60. Applying the permutation would result in: 1, 10, 30, 60.
 *               The result is sorted in ascending order, this is allowed.
 *             - strides of block #2: 1, 5, 50, 100. Applying permuation would result in: 5, 1, 50, 100.
 *               The result is _not_ sorted in ascending order, this is _not_ allowed.
 * \param[in] dataType Data type of the stored entries. We assume the same datatype for each block.
 *            Currently, the only supported values are CUDA_C_64F, CUDA_C_32F, CUDA_R_64F, and CUDA_R_32F.
 * \remarks non-blocking, no reentrant, and thread-safe

 * For every mode, the segmentation of that mode must be identical in all
 * tensors that it occurs in. For example, if modeA[i] = modeB[j] for some i
 * and j, then numSectionsPerMode[i] of tensor A must have the same value as
 * numSectionsPerMode[j] of tensor B, and the corresponding section extents 
 * must be identical.
 *
 * For example, let A, B, and C be block matrices and consider the ordinary 
 * matrix-matrix product \f$C_{mn}=A_{mk}B_{kn}\f$. Then:
 *      - Mode 'm': C and A need to have the same number of block-rows, and 
 *        each block-row of C needs to contain the same number of rows as the 
 *        corresponding block-row of A.
 *      - Mode 'n': C and B need to have the same number of block-columns of 
 *        matching size
 *      - Mode 'k': A needs to have the same number of block-columns as B has
 *        block-rows, and each block-column of A needs to consist of the same 
 *        number of columns as the number of rows in the corresponding 
 *        block-row of B.
 *
 * At the moment, descC and descD must be identical, i.e., the same opaque
