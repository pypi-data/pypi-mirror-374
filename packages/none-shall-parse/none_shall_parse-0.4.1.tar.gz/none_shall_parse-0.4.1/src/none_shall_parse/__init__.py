"""Trinity Shared Python utilities.

A collection of shared utilities for Trinity projects.

Originally intended to be parsing utilities, this grew to include
other useful functions.

Named for its author Andries Niemandt - whose surname loosely
translates to "none". Combined this with our parsing intentions
to create a name which nods to the Black Knight in Monty Python's Holy Grail.
