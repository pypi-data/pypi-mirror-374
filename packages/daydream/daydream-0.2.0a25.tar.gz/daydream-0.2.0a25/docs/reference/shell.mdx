title: Shell Commands
---

Shell Commands allow [Agents](/concepts/agents) to run standard
UNIX and custom shell commands.

<Note>
  Unlike other agentic tools, Daydream will **only** run the shell commands
  you have explicitly configured.
</Note>


## Configuration
Enable the Shell Commands plugin by editing the `~/.daydream/profiles/<profile_name>/config.yaml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  # ...
  shell:
    enabled: true
    settings:
      commands: []
```

### Defining Shell Commands
You must explicitly define each shell command you want to make available to
Agents. For example:

```yaml
plugins:
  # ...
  shell:
    enabled: true
    settings:
      commands:
        - handle: get_current_directory
          description: Get the path to the current directory.
          command: pwd
```

Each command requires a `handle` (which must be unique), a `description` (which
helps the LLM decide when to use it) and the `command` itself.

### Commands With Arguments


## Environment


## Tools
Each shell command you define ends up as an Agent / MCP tool, named with the
`shell_` prefix.

For example, a command with the handle `get_current_directory` will result in
a new tool named `shell_get_current_directory`.


## Developing & Testing Commands
The easiest way to develop and test new shell commands is by using the
`daydream tools` subcommands.

To list all tools, including your custom shell commands, run:

```bash
$ uv run daydream tools list
```

To call a tool via the CLI and test your command, you can run:

```bash
$ uv run daydream tools call shell_<your command handle> <arguments>
```

For example:

```bash
$ uv run daydream tools call shell_get_current_directory
/Users/michael/dev/daydream
```
