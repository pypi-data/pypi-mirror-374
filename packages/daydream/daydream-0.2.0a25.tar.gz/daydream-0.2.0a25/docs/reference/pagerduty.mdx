title: PagerDuty
---

Our PagerDuty integration allows [Agents](/concepts/agents) to learn about, filter, and
take action on incidents happening in your infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

To configure the PagerDuty integration you'll need to generate a PagerDuty
API key.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your PagerDuty 'User Settings' page">
    In the top right corner of the PagerDuty UI, hover over your profile image
    and click on "My Profile".

    Then open the "User Settings" tab:

    ![PagerDuty User Settings](/images/pagerduty/user-settings.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate API Token">
    Click on "Create API User Token":

    ![PagerDuty API Token](/images/pagerduty/user-token.png)
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Configuration
Configure the PagerDuty plugin by running `uv run daydream configure` or by editing
the `~/.daydream/profiles/<profile_name>/config.yaml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  # ...
  pagerduty:
    enabled: true
    settings:
      api_key: <your api key> # required
      from_email: <email address for status updates> # optional
```


## Developing Agents
Your Agents can react to PagerDuty incidents by adding context from your
[Knowledge Graph](/concepts/knowledge-graph), pulling [Metrics](/reference/metrics),
or running custom [Shell Commands](/reference/shell).

Learn more about [Creating Agents](/concepts/agents).

### Running Locally
You can test your Agents locally on past or current PagerDuty incidents by
passing in a PagerDuty incident URL as the payload to `daydream agent run`:

```bash
uv run daydream agent run <agent_name> https://youraccount.pagerduty.com/incidents/Q179JHZ8AMBVDO
```

Daydream will fetch the incident automatically and send it to your Agent. The
Agent thought process, tool calls, and output will be printed to `stdout`.

### Webhooks
Agent workflows can run automatically by configuring PagerDuty to send webhooks
to your [Daydream Server](/server).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the PagerDuty Webhooks page">
    In the top navigation hover over "Integrations" and then click on
    "Generic Webhooks (v3)".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a New Webhook">
    Click on "+ New Webhook"

    The **Webhook URL** should be the hostname of your running Daydream Server,
    with a path of `/webhook` (like `https://daydream.yourdomain.com/webhook`).

    During development you can tunnel to your local Daydream instance using ngrok by
    running `uv run daydream agent serve --tunnel` (see [Daydream Server](/server)
    for details).

    The **Event Subscriptions** should be whatever events you want to run Agent
    workflows on, for example `incident.triggered`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Daydream will now receive webhooks from PagerDuty and send them to the
[Router](/concepts/router), which will decide which [Agent](/concepts/agents) workflow to run.
