🔮 Solomonoff Program Generation - Modular Architecture (Refactored)
====================================================================

Refactored from original 2,356-line monolith to modular 4-file architecture.
Now imports from specialized modules to meet 800-line standard.

Author: Benedict Chen (benedict@benedictchen.com)
Based on: Solomonoff (1964) - Universal induction via program enumeration

Original: 2,356 lines (3x over limit) → 4 modules averaging 374 lines each
Total reduction: 37% while preserving 100% functionality

Modules:
- program_generation_core.py (338 lines) - Main coordination class
- program_generation_patterns.py (395 lines) - Mathematical pattern detection  
- program_generation_utm.py (342 lines) - Universal Turing Machine simulation
- program_generation_advanced.py (420 lines) - Compression, context tree, hybrid

This file serves as backward compatibility wrapper while the system migrates
to the new modular architecture.

🔄 MIGRATION GUIDE: From Monolithic to Modular Architecture
===========================================================

OLD (2,356-line monolith):
```python
from program_generation import ProgramGenerationMixin

class MySolomonoff(ProgramGenerationMixin):
    # All 18 methods in one massive class
```

NEW (4 modular files):
```python
from program_generation_core import ProgramGenerationMixin

class MySolomonoff(ProgramGenerationMixin):
    # Clean inheritance from modular mixins
    # PatternGenerationMixin, UTMSimulationMixin, AdvancedGenerationMixin
```

✅ BENEFITS:
- 37% code reduction (2,356 → 1,495 lines)
- All files under 800-line limit  
- Logical organization by functionality
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Clean separation of concerns

🎯 USAGE REMAINS IDENTICAL:
All public methods work exactly the same!
Only internal organization changed.
