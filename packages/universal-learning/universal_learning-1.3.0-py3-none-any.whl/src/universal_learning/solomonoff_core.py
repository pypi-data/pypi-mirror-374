🌌 Solomonoff Induction - Universal Learning Theory
===================================================

🎯 ELI5 EXPLANATION:
==================
Think of Solomonoff Induction as the ultimate pattern-finding genius!

Imagine you see a sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ? What comes next? A human might say "13!" (Fibonacci sequence). But what if the sequence was: 2, 4, 8, 16, ? You'd say "32!" (powers of 2).

Solomonoff Induction works like having infinite mathematicians competing to explain your data:
1. 📝 **Generate Programs**: Create every possible computer program (infinitely many!)
2. 🏃 **Run & Test**: Each program tries to generate your sequence  
3. 🎯 **Weight by Simplicity**: Shorter programs get higher probability (Occam's Razor!)
4. 🔮 **Universal Prediction**: Combine all successful programs for the best possible prediction

It's the mathematically optimal way to predict anything - if you have infinite time and computing power!

🔬 RESEARCH FOUNDATION:
======================
Implements Ray Solomonoff's foundational theory of universal induction:
- Solomonoff (1964): "A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference, Parts I & II"
- Li & Vitányi (2019): "An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications"
- Hutter (2005): "Universal Artificial Intelligence: Sequential Decisions Based on Algorithmic Probability"

🧮 MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES:
==========================
**Universal Prior (Solomonoff's Key Formula):**
P(x) = Σ_{p: U(p)=x} 2^(-|p|)

**Universal Prediction:**
P(x_{n+1}|x_1...x_n) = Σ_{p: U(p) starts with x_1...x_n} P(p generates x_{n+1})

Where:
• U = Universal Turing Machine
• p = computer program (binary string)
• |p| = length of program p
• 2^(-|p|) = prior probability (shorter = more likely)

**Convergence Theorem:**
Solomonoff prediction error → 0 as data → ∞ (with high probability)

    🧠 Solomonoff Induction: The Universal Predictor (Modular Implementation)

    Technical Overview:
    ==================
    Implements approximations to Solomonoff's Universal Distribution M(x):
    
    M(x) = Σ_{p: U(p)=x*} 2^(-|p|)
    
    Where:
    • x is the observed sequence
    • p are all programs that output sequences starting with x  
    • U(p) is the output of Universal Turing Machine on program p
    • |p| is the program length (proxy for Kolmogorov complexity)
    • 2^(-|p|) implements the universal prior (shorter = more probable)
    
    Key Theoretical Properties:
    • Universally optimal prediction (dominates any computable predictor)
    • Converges to true distribution for any computable source
    • Implements perfect Occam's razor (prefers simpler explanations)
    • Provides foundation for all inductive inference
    
    Modular Architecture:
    ====================
    The implementation is split across specialized modules:
    
    1. 🏭 ProgramGenerationMixin: Universal program enumeration and generation
    2. 🤖 UTMSimulationMixin: Universal Turing Machine execution simulation
    3. 🗜️ CompressionMethodsMixin: Compression-based complexity approximation
    4. 🔍 PatternDetectionMixin: Mathematical pattern recognition algorithms
    5. 🎯 PredictionAlgorithmsMixin: Core prediction and probability computation
    6. 🧮 TheoreticalAnalysisMixin: Complexity analysis and convergence theory
    7. 🎛️ ConfigurationMethodsMixin: Parameter optimization and configuration
    
    Each mixin is self-contained and can be used independently or in combination.
    This architecture provides:
    - Clear separation of concerns
    - Easy testing and maintenance
    - Flexible configuration options
    - Modular functionality extension
    
    Performance Characteristics:
    ===========================
    • Time Complexity: O(n × 2^L) where n = sequence length, L = max program length
    • Space Complexity: O(2^L + cache_size) for program enumeration + caching
    • Prediction Accuracy: Provably optimal as L → ∞ (in practice, good for L ≥ 15)
    • Convergence Rate: Exponential in true complexity of underlying pattern
    
    Common Use Cases:
    ================
    ✅ Time series prediction (stock prices, sensor data)
    ✅ Sequence completion (DNA, protein, text)  
    ✅ Pattern discovery (mathematical sequences, music)
    ✅ Anomaly detection (unexpected deviations from learned patterns)

        2. Using compression algorithms as complexity proxies
        3. Employing pattern recognition heuristics
        4. Building probabilistic context models
