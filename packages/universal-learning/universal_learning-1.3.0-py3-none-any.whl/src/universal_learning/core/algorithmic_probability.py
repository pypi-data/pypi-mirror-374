🧠 Universal Learning - Algorithmic Probability Core  
====================================================

🎯 ELI5 EXPLANATION:
==================
Imagine you're a detective trying to solve the ultimate mystery: "What pattern explains everything I've seen?"

Your brain does this constantly! When you see "1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...", you immediately think "Fibonacci sequence!" But how do you know that's the "right" answer versus "random numbers" or "some other pattern"?

Algorithmic Probability gives the perfect answer using Occam's Razor with math:
1. 🔍 **Consider**: All possible programs that could generate your data
2. ⚖️ **Weight**: Shorter programs get higher probability (Occam's Razor!)  
3. 🧮 **Sum**: Add up all programs weighted by their simplicity
4. 🎯 **Result**: The most elegant explanation that perfectly balances simplicity and accuracy

This is literally the optimal way to learn from data - mathematically provable!

🔬 RESEARCH FOUNDATION:
======================
Implements Ray Solomonoff's groundbreaking universal theory of inductive inference:
- Solomonoff (1964): "A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference, Part I & II"
- Li & Vitányi (1997): "An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications"
- Hutter (2005): "Universal Artificial Intelligence: Sequential Decisions Based On Algorithmic Probability"
- Schmidhuber (2002): "Hierarchies of Generalized Kolmogorov Complexities"

🧮 MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES:
==========================
**Universal Distribution (Solomonoff's Crown Jewel):**
P(x) = Σ_{p:U(p)=x} 2^(-|p|)

Where:
• P(x) = algorithmic probability of string x
• U = universal Turing machine
• p = program that outputs x when run on U
• |p| = length of program p in bits
• 2^(-|p|) = prior probability (shorter = more likely)

**Kolmogorov Complexity:**
K(x) = min{|p| : U(p) = x}
(Length of shortest program that outputs x)

**Universal Prediction:**
P(x_{n+1}|x_1...x_n) = Σ_p P(p|x_1...x_n) × P_{p}(x_{n+1}|x_1...x_n)

**Convergence Guarantee:**
Total expected mistakes ≤ K(f) + O(log n)
(Where f is the true generating function)

🎯 UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE:
   - Every pattern in the universe has an algorithmic probability
   - Simpler explanations get exponentially higher weight
   - Perfect balance between model complexity and data fit
   - Mathematically optimal inductive inference
