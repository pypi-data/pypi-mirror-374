## Theoretical Foundations

### Solomonoff Induction Theory
Ray Solomonoff's theory provides the optimal solution to the inductive inference problem:

#### Algorithmic Probability
For any finite binary string x, the algorithmic probability is:
```
P(x) = Σ_{p: U(p) = x} 2^(-|p|)
```
Where U is a universal Turing machine and the sum is over all programs p that output x.

#### Universal Prior
The Solomonoff prior is the theoretically optimal prior for inductive inference:
- **Completeness**: Assigns non-zero probability to any computable sequence
- **Universality**: Converges to the true probability faster than any other computable prior
- **Optimality**: Minimizes total expected prediction error

#### Sequential Prediction
For predicting the next bit of a sequence x₁x₂...xₙ:
```
P(xₙ₊₁ = 1 | x₁...xₙ) = P(x₁...xₙ1) / P(x₁...xₙ)
```

### AIXI Framework
Marcus Hutter's AIXI represents the theoretical optimum for general reinforcement learning:

#### Agent-Environment Interaction
The agent interacts with an environment through action-observation-reward cycles:
- **Actions**: a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ from finite action space
- **Observations**: o₁, o₂, ..., oₙ from finite observation space  
- **Rewards**: r₁, r₂, ..., rₙ from finite reward space

#### AIXI Agent Definition
The AIXI agent maximizes expected future rewards:
```
aₜ = arg max_a Σ_{or} ... Σ_{oᵣ} [rₜ + ... + rₘ] · P(oₜrₜ...oₘrₘ | a₁o₁r₁...aₜ₋₁oₜ₋₁rₜ₋₁aₜ)
```
Where P is the Solomonoff prior over environment programs.

#### Universal Intelligence
AIXI is provably optimal in the sense that:
- It eventually learns any computable environment
- Its performance approaches that of any other agent
- It represents the gold standard for artificial general intelligence

### Kolmogorov Complexity
Algorithmic information theory quantifies the information content of individual objects:

#### Definition
The Kolmogorov complexity K(x) of a string x is:
```
K(x) = min{|p| : U(p) = x}
```
The length of the shortest program that outputs x on universal machine U.

#### Key Properties
- **Objectivity**: Independent of description method (up to constant)
- **Uncomputability**: K(x) is not computable in general
- **Optimality**: Shortest possible description length
- **Randomness**: Random strings have high Kolmogorov complexity
