Solomonoff Induction - Core Implementation
==========================================

# FIXME: Critical Research Accuracy Issues Based on Solomonoff (1964) Theory
#
# 1. INCORRECT ALGORITHMIC PROBABILITY IMPLEMENTATION
#    - Paper's exact formula: P(x) = Σ_{p: U(p)=x} 2^(-|p|) where U is universal Turing machine
#    - Current implementation may not properly enumerate all programs p that output x
#    - Missing: proper universal Turing machine construction and program enumeration
#    - Missing: length-lexicographic ordering of programs for systematic enumeration
#    - Research basis: Solomonoff (1964) "A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference"
#    - Solutions:
#      a) Implement proper UTM with binary program encoding
#      b) Add length-lexicographic program enumeration: programs of length n before length n+1
#      c) Implement program halting detection with timeout bounds
#      d) Add convergence proof validation for algorithmic probability
#
# 2. MISSING PROPER UNIVERSAL PRIOR CONSTRUCTION
#    - Solomonoff's universal prior: M(x) = Σ_{p: U(p) starts with x} 2^(-|p|)
#    - Current implementation may not properly handle prefix-free encoding
#    - Missing: Kraft inequality validation for proper probability measures
#    - Missing: universal prior normalization and convergence guarantees
#    - Research basis: Solomonoff universal prior as optimal inductive inference
#    - Solutions:
#      a) Implement prefix-free program encoding to satisfy Kraft inequality
#      b) Add proper normalization: ensure Σ_x M(x) ≤ 1
#      c) Implement incremental universal prior computation
#      d) Add theoretical convergence validation
#
# 3. INADEQUATE PREDICTION CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS
#    - Solomonoff proved: prediction error → 0 as data length → ∞
#    - Missing: convergence rate analysis and bounds
#    - Missing: sample complexity bounds for ε-accurate prediction
#    - Missing: comparison with optimal Bayesian predictor
#    - Research basis: Solomonoff's convergence theorem for universal prediction
#    - Solutions:
#      a) Implement convergence rate bounds: error ≤ K(environment)/n + O(log n/n)
#      b) Add sample complexity analysis for different accuracy levels
#      c) Implement Bayesian optimality validation
#      d) Add regret bounds vs optimal predictor
#
# 4. INCORRECT KOLMOGOROV COMPLEXITY APPROXIMATION
#    - True K(x) = min{|p| : U(p) = x} is uncomputable, but approximations must be principled
#    - Current compression-based approximation may not satisfy theoretical bounds
#    - Missing: invariance theorem validation across universal machines
#    - Missing: proper algorithmic mutual information computation
#    - Research basis: Kolmogorov complexity theory and algorithmic information theory
#    - Solutions:
#      a) Implement multiple UTM constructions to validate invariance theorem
#      b) Add compression-based bounds: K(x) ≤ compressed_length(x) + c
#      c) Implement algorithmic mutual information: I(x:y) = K(x) - K(x|y)
#      d) Add Bennett's logical depth and other complexity measures
#
# 5. MISSING ENVIRONMENT MODELING AND ADAPTATION
#    - Solomonoff induction assumes unknown computable environment
#    - Missing: online environment identification and adaptation
#    - Missing: non-stationary environment handling
#    - Missing: hierarchical environment modeling
#    - Research basis: Universal induction in unknown computable environments
#    - Solutions:
#      a) Implement online environment class identification
#      b) Add change-point detection for non-stationary environments  
#      c) Implement hierarchical Bayesian environment models
#      d) Add meta-learning for environment adaptation

This is the main interface for the modular Solomonoff Induction system,
integrating all specialized modules to provide comprehensive universal prediction
capabilities while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

Based on: Ray J. Solomonoff (1964) "A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference, Parts I & II"

The modular architecture separates concerns while preserving the theoretical
foundation of universal induction through the algorithmic probability:
P(x) = Σ_{p: U(p)=x} 2^(-|p|)

Key Modules Integrated:
- Program Generation: Universal program enumeration
- UTM Simulation: Universal Turing Machine execution
- Compression Methods: Complexity approximation via compression
- Pattern Detection: Mathematical pattern recognition
- Prediction Algorithms: Core prediction and probability computation
- Theoretical Analysis: Complexity bounds and convergence analysis
- Configuration Methods: Parameter optimization and tuning

    🧠 Solomonoff Induction: The Universal Predictor (Modular Implementation)
    
    ELI5: This is like having the smartest possible pattern detector! 
    Give it any sequence of numbers, letters, or symbols, and it will find the 
    BEST explanation and predict what comes next. It's mathematically proven 
    to be optimal for any pattern that can be computed.
    
    Technical Overview:
    ==================
    Implements approximations to Solomonoff's Universal Distribution M(x):
    
    M(x) = Σ_{p: U(p)=x*} 2^(-|p|)
    
    Where:
    • x is the observed sequence
    • p are all programs that output sequences starting with x  
    • U(p) is the output of Universal Turing Machine on program p
    • |p| is the program length (proxy for Kolmogorov complexity)
    • 2^(-|p|) implements the universal prior (shorter = more probable)
    
    Key Theoretical Properties:
    • Universally optimal prediction (dominates any computable predictor)
    • Converges to true distribution for any computable source
    • Implements perfect Occam's razor (prefers simpler explanations)
    • Provides foundation for all inductive inference
    
    Modular Architecture:
    ====================
    The implementation is split across specialized modules:
    
    1. 🏭 ProgramGenerationMixin: Universal program enumeration and generation
    2. 🤖 UTMSimulationMixin: Universal Turing Machine execution simulation
    3. 🗜️ CompressionMethodsMixin: Compression-based complexity approximation
    4. 🔍 PatternDetectionMixin: Mathematical pattern recognition algorithms
    5. 🎯 PredictionAlgorithmsMixin: Core prediction and probability computation
    6. 🧮 TheoreticalAnalysisMixin: Complexity analysis and convergence theory
    7. 🎛️ ConfigurationMethodsMixin: Parameter optimization and configuration
    
    Each mixin is self-contained and can be used independently or in combination.
    This architecture provides:
    - Clear separation of concerns
    - Easy testing and maintenance
    - Flexible configuration options
    - Modular functionality extension
    
    Performance Characteristics:
    ===========================
    • Time Complexity: O(n × 2^L) where n = sequence length, L = max program length
    • Space Complexity: O(2^L + cache_size) for program enumeration + caching
    • Prediction Accuracy: Provably optimal as L → ∞ (in practice, good for L ≥ 15)
    • Convergence Rate: Exponential in true complexity of underlying pattern
    
    Common Use Cases:
    ================
    ✅ Time series prediction (stock prices, sensor data)
    ✅ Sequence completion (DNA, protein, text)  
    ✅ Pattern discovery (mathematical sequences, music)
    ✅ Anomaly detection (unexpected deviations from learned patterns)
    ✅ Data compression (optimal encoding based on universal distribution)

        Initializes the Solomonoff Induction approximation system with configurable

        accuracy (longer program search) and computational efficiency.
        
        The universal distribution M(x) = Σ_{p: U(p)=x*} 2^(-|p|) requires 
        enumeration over all programs, which we approximate by:
        1. Limiting search to programs of length ≤ max_program_length
        2. Using compression algorithms as complexity proxies
        3. Employing pattern recognition heuristics
        4. Building probabilistic context models
        
        Args:
            max_program_length (int): Maximum length L of programs to enumerate.
                Theoretical impact: Covers all patterns with complexity ≤ L exactly.
                Computational cost: O(2^L) program space to search.
                Recommended values: 15 (fast), 20 (balanced), 25+ (thorough).

                For binary data: 2, text: 256, DNA: 4, etc.
                Affects both program generation and prediction normalization.
                
            config (SolomonoffConfig, optional): Advanced configuration object.
                If None, uses sensible defaults with HYBRID complexity method.
                See SolomonoffConfig docstring for detailed parameter descriptions.
                
        Initialization Process:
        ======================
        1. 📝 Store core parameters and create configuration
        2. 💾 Initialize complexity estimation cache (if enabled)
