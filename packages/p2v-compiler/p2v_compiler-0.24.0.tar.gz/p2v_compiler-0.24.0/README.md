# ðŸš€ P2V â€“ Designing Chips in Python  
**Python to Verilog Compiler**

---

## ðŸ“˜ What Is P2V?
**P2V** is a Python library for generating synthesizable RTL. It lets chip designers express RTL modules in Python, then compiles them into Verilog.

---

## ðŸ‘¥ Who Is P2V For?
For hardware designers familiar with Verilog and Python who want higher-level abstraction and automation in RTL creation.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Install P2V using pip:

```bash
pip install p2v-compiler
```

P2V is a native Python 3 library with no mandatory external dependencies. However, some advanced features rely on the following open-source tools:

| Tool      | Purpose                   | Link |
|-----------|---------------------------|------|
| Verible   | Verilog indentation        | [Verible GitHub](https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible) |
| Verilator | Verilog linting            | [Verilator Install Guide](https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html) |
| Icarus    | Verilog simulation         | [Icarus Install Guide](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/usage/installation.html) |

## ðŸ‘‹ Hello World Example

Run the tutorial:

```bash
python3 p2v/tutorial/example0_hello_world/hello_world.py
```

Sample output:
```
p2v-INFO: created: hello_world.sv
p2v-INFO: verilog generation completed successfully (1 sec)
p2v-INFO: verilog lint completed successfully
p2v-INFO: completed successfully
```
