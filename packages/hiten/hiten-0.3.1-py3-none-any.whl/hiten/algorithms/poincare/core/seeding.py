    The role of a *seed generator* is to provide one or more initial states
    whose trajectories will be iterated until they reach the section defined by
    a :class:`_SurfaceEvent`.  The concrete strategy decides *how* those seeds
    are distributed (axis-aligned rays, random cloud, CM turning-point logic, â€¦)
    but *not* how they are propagated - that is handled by the return-map
    engine.

    The interface is intentionally minimal so that existing centre-manifold
    strategies can be *adapted* with a thin wrapper rather than rewritten.

        dynsys
            The dynamical system that will be propagated.
        surface
            Target section; a generator may use its definition to align seeds
            conveniently with the crossing plane.
        n_seeds
            Desired number of seeds (generators may return fewer if not
            feasible).

            Extra implementation-specific parameters (e.g. energy level for CM
