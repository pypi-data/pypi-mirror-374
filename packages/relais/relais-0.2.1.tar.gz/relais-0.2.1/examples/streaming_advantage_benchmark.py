Streaming Advantage Benchmark: Where Relais Really Shines

This benchmark demonstrates relais's key advantage: true streaming through multi-stage pipelines.
Unlike pure asyncio which processes in batches, relais allows items to flow through
pipeline stages as soon as they're ready.

Key scenarios where relais excels:
1. Multi-stage pipelines (3+ stages)
2. Mixed operation speeds (some fast, some slow)
3. Early results needed (streaming output)
4. Memory constraints (don't want to buffer everything)
