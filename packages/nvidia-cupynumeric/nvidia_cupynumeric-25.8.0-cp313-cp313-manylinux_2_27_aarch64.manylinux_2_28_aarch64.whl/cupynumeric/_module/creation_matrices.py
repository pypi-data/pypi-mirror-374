    """

    Extract a diagonal or construct a diagonal array.

    See the more detailed documentation for ``cupynumeric.diagonal`` if you use
    this function to extract a diagonal and wish to write to the resulting
    array; whether it returns a copy or a view depends on what version of numpy
    you are using.

    Parameters
    ----------
    v : array_like
        If `v` is a 2-D array, return a copy of its `k`-th diagonal.
        If `v` is a 1-D array, return a 2-D array with `v` on the `k`-th
        diagonal.
    k : int, optional
        Diagonal in question. The default is 0. Use `k>0` for diagonals
        above the main diagonal, and `k<0` for diagonals below the main
        diagonal.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The extracted diagonal or constructed diagonal array.

    An array with ones at and below the given diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        Number of rows in the array.
    M : int, optional
        Number of columns in the array.
        By default, `M` is taken equal to `N`.
    k : int, optional
        The sub-diagonal at and below which the array is filled.
        `k` = 0 is the main diagonal, while `k` < 0 is below it,
        and `k` > 0 is above.  The default is 0.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Data type of the returned array.  The default is float.
    like : array_like
        Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not NumPy
        arrays. If an array-like passed in as `like` supports the
        `__array_function__` protocol, the result will be defined by it. In
        this case it ensures the creation of an array object compatible with
        that passed in via this argument.

    Returns
    -------
    tri : ndarray of shape (N, M)
        Array with its lower triangle filled with ones and zero elsewhere;
        in other words ``T[i,j] == 1`` for ``j <= i + k``, 0 otherwise.
