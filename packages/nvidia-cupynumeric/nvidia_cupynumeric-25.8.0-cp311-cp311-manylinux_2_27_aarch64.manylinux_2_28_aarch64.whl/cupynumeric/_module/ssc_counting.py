    Counts the number of non-zero values in the array ``a``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        The array for which to count non-zeros.
    axis : int or tuple, optional
        Axis or tuple of axes along which to count non-zeros.
        Default is None, meaning that non-zeros will be counted
        along a flattened version of ``a``.

    Returns
    -------
    count : int or ndarray[int]
        Number of non-zero values in the array along a given axis.
        Otherwise, the total number of non-zero values in the array
        is returned.
