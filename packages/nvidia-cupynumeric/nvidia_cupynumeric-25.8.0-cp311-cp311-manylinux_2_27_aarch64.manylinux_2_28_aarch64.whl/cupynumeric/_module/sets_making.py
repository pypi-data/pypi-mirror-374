    """

    Find the unique elements of an array.
    Returns the sorted unique elements of an array. There are three optional
    outputs in addition to the unique elements:
    * the indices of the input array that give the unique values
    * the indices of the unique array that reconstruct the input array
    * the number of times each unique value comes up in the input array

    Parameters
    ----------
    ar : array_like
        Input array. Unless `axis` is specified, this will be flattened if it
        is not already 1-D.
    return_index : bool, optional
        If True, also return the indices of `ar` (along the specified axis,
        if provided, or in the flattened array) that result in the unique
        array.
        Currently not supported.
    return_inverse : bool, optional
        If True, also return the indices of the unique array (for the specified
        axis, if provided) that can be used to reconstruct `ar`.
        Currently not supported.
    return_counts : bool, optional
        If True, also return the number of times each unique item appears
        in `ar`.
        Currently not supported.
    axis : int or None, optional
        The axis to operate on. If None, `ar` will be flattened. If an integer,
        the subarrays indexed by the given axis will be flattened and treated
        as the elements of a 1-D array with the dimension of the given axis,
        see the notes for more details.  Object arrays or structured arrays
        that contain objects are not supported if the `axis` kwarg is used. The
        default is None.
        Currently not supported.

    Returns
    -------
    unique : ndarray
        The sorted unique values.
    unique_indices : ndarray, optional
        The indices of the first occurrences of the unique values in the
        original array. Only provided if `return_index` is True.
    unique_inverse : ndarray, optional
        The indices to reconstruct the original array from the
        unique array. Only provided if `return_inverse` is True.
    unique_counts : ndarray, optional
        The number of times each of the unique values comes up in the
        original array. Only provided if `return_counts` is True.

    --------

    Availability
    --------
    Multiple GPUs, Multiple CPUs

    Notes
    --------
    Keyword arguments for optional outputs are not yet supported.
    `axis` is also not handled currently.
