    Dot product of two arrays. Specifically,

    - If both `a` and `b` are 1-D arrays, it is inner product of vectors

    - If both `a` and `b` are 2-D arrays, it is matrix multiplication,
      but using ``a @ b`` is preferred.

    - If either `a` or `b` is 0-D (scalar), it is equivalent to
      :func:`multiply` and using ``cupynumeric.multiply(a, b)`` or ``a * b`` is
      preferred.

    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is a 1-D array, it is a sum product over
      the last axis of `a` and `b`.

    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is an M-D array (where ``M>=2``), it is a

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : array_like
        Input arrays, scalars not allowed.
    out : ndarray, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that matches the signature `(n,k),(k,m)->(n,m)`.
    casting : ``{'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}``, optional
        Controls what kind of data casting may occur.

          * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
          * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
          * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
          * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
            like float64 to float32, are allowed.
          * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.

        Default is 'same_kind'.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        If provided, forces the calculation to use the data type specified.
        Note that you may have to also give a more liberal `casting`
        parameter to allow the conversions. Default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        The matrix product of the inputs.
        This is a scalar only when both a, b are 1-d vectors.
        If `out` is given, then it is returned.

    Notes
    -----
    The behavior depends on the arguments in the following way.

    - If both arguments are 2-D they are multiplied like conventional
      matrices.
    - If either argument is N-D, N > 2, it is treated as a stack of
      matrices residing in the last two indexes and broadcast accordingly.
    - If the first argument is 1-D, it is promoted to a matrix by
      prepending a 1 to its dimensions. After matrix multiplication
      the prepended 1 is removed.
    - If the second argument is 1-D, it is promoted to a matrix by
      appending a 1 to its dimensions. After matrix multiplication
      the appended 1 is removed.

    ``matmul`` differs from ``dot`` in two important ways:

    - Multiplication by scalars is not allowed, use ``*`` instead.
    - Stacks of matrices are broadcast together as if the matrices
      were elements, respecting the signature ``(n,k),(k,m)->(n,m)``:

      >>> a = ones([9, 5, 7, 4])
      >>> c = ones([9, 5, 4, 3])
      >>> dot(a: ndarray, c).shape
      (9, 5, 7, 9, 5, 3)
      >>> matmul(a: ndarray, c).shape
      (9, 5, 7, 3)
      >>> # n is 7, k is 4, m is 3

    The cuPyNumeric implementation is a little more liberal than NumPy in terms
    of allowed broadcasting, e.g. ``matmul(ones((3,1)), ones((4,5)))`` is

    Evaluates the Einstein summation convention on the operands.

    Using the Einstein summation convention, many common multi-dimensional,
    linear algebraic array operations can be represented in a simple fashion.
    In *implicit* mode `einsum` computes these values.

    In *explicit* mode, `einsum` provides further flexibility to compute
    other array operations that might not be considered classical Einstein
    summation operations, by disabling, or forcing summation over specified
    subscript labels.

    Parameters
    ----------
    subscripts : str
        Specifies the subscripts for summation as comma separated list of
        subscript labels. An implicit (classical Einstein summation)
        calculation is performed unless the explicit indicator '->' is
        included as well as subscript labels of the precise output form.
    operands : list[array_like]
        These are the arrays for the operation.
    out : ndarray, optional
        If provided, the calculation is done into this array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        If provided, forces the calculation to use the data type specified.
        Note that you may have to also give a more liberal `casting`
        parameter to allow the conversions. Default is None.
    casting : ``{'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}``, optional
        Controls what kind of data casting may occur.

          * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
          * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
          * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
          * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
            like float64 to float32, are allowed.
          * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.

        Default is 'safe'.
    optimize : ``{False, True, 'greedy', 'optimal'}``, optional
        Controls if intermediate optimization should occur. If False then
        arrays will be contracted in input order, one at a time. True (the
        default) will use the 'greedy' algorithm. See
        ``cupynumeric.einsum_path`` for more information on the available
        optimization algorithms.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        The calculation based on the Einstein summation convention.

    Notes
    -----
    For most expressions, only floating-point types are supported.

    """
    Evaluates the lowest cost contraction order for an einsum expression by
    considering the creation of intermediate arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    expr : str
        Specifies the subscripts for summation.
    *operands : Sequence[array_like]
        These are the arrays for the operation.
    optimize : ``{bool, list, tuple, 'greedy', 'optimal'}``
        Choose the type of path. If a tuple is provided, the second argument is
        assumed to be the maximum intermediate size created. If only a single
        argument is provided the largest input or output array size is used
        as a maximum intermediate size.

        * if a list is given that starts with ``einsum_path``, uses this as the
          contraction path
        * if False no optimization is taken
        * if True defaults to the 'greedy' algorithm
        * 'optimal' An algorithm that combinatorially explores all possible
          ways of contracting the listed tensors and chooses the least costly
          path. Scales exponentially with the number of terms in the
          contraction.
        * 'greedy' An algorithm that chooses the best pair contraction
          at each step. Effectively, this algorithm searches the largest inner,
          Hadamard, and then outer products at each step. Scales cubically with
          the number of terms in the contraction. Equivalent to the 'optimal'
          path for most contractions.

        Default is 'greedy'.

    Returns
    -------
    path : list[tuple[int,...]]
        A list representation of the einsum path.
    string_repr : str
        A printable representation of the einsum path.

    Notes
    -----
    The resulting path indicates which terms of the input contraction should be
    contracted first, the result of this contraction is then appended to the
    end of the contraction list. This list can then be iterated over until all
    intermediate contractions are complete.

    Return the sum along diagonals of the array.

    If a is 2-D, the sum along its diagonal with the given offset is
    returned, i.e., the sum of elements a[i,i+offset] for all i.
    If a has more than two dimensions, then the axes specified by axis1
    and axis2 are used to determine the 2-D sub-arrays whose traces
    are returned. The shape of the resulting array is the same as that
    of a with axis1 and axis2 removed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array, from which the diagonals are taken.
    offset : int, optional
        Offset of the diagonal from the main diagonal. Can be both
        positive and negative. Defaults to 0.
    axis1, axis2 : int, optional
        Axes to be used as the first and second axis of the 2-D sub-arrays

        first two axes of a.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Determines the data-type of the returned array and of the
        accumulator where the elements are summed. If dtype has the value
        None and a is of integer type of precision less than the default
        integer precision, then the default integer precision is used.
        Otherwise, the precision is the same as that of a.

    out : ndarray, optional
        Array into which the output is placed. Its type is preserved and
        it must be of the right shape to hold the output.

    Returns
    -------
    sum_along_diagonals : ndarray
        If a is 2-D, the sum along the diagonal is returned. If a has
        larger dimensions, then an array of sums along diagonals is returned.
