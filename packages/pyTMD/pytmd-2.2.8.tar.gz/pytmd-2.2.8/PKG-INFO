Python-based tidal prediction software for estimating ocean, load, solid Earth and pole tides

For more information: see the documentation at [pytmd.readthedocs.io](https://pytmd.readthedocs.io/)

## Installation

From PyPI:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pyTMD
```

To include all optional dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pyTMD[all]
```

Using `conda` or `mamba` from conda-forge:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pytmd
```

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge pytmd
```

Development version from GitHub:

```bash
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/pyTMD/pyTMD.git
```

### Running with Pixi

Alternatively, you can use [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) for a streamlined workspace environment:

1. Install Pixi following the [installation instructions](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation)
2. Clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyTMD/pyTMD.git
```

3. Move into the `pyTMD` directory

```bash
cd pyTMD
```

4. Install dependencies and start JupyterLab:

```bash
pixi run start
```

This will automatically create the environment, install all dependencies, and launch JupyterLab in the [notebooks](./doc/source/notebooks/) directory.

## Dependencies

- [dateutil: powerful extensions to datetime](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
