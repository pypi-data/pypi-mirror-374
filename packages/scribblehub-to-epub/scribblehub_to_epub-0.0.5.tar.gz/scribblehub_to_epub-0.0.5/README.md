## Notes

The default behavior includes author quotes in the EPUB to show appreciation for the author's work. While there's an option to disable this (`--disable-author-quotes`), it's recommended to keep them enabled to support the authors.

If you encounter any issues with the EPUB formatting of author notes, please consider reporting them as issues rather than immediately disabling the quotes.
