## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

- Python 3.12+
- Valid credentials (username/password) for an active Workday Adaptive Planning account
  - wdadaptivepy will be limited to the access granted to the Adaptive user (ie: wdadaptivepy will respect Adaptive's user security)

### Installation

- Run `pip install wdadaptivepy`

## Example Usage

```python
from wdadaptivepy import AdaptiveConnection


adaptive = AdaptiveConnection(username="YOUR_ADAPTIVE@USER.NAME", password="Y0urP@$$w0rd!")

# Update Level names containing " - OLD"
levels = adaptive.levels.get_all()
for level in levels:
    level.name.replace(" - OLD", " - NEW")
adaptive.levels.update(levels)

# Create new Accounts from CSV file
accounts = adaptive.accounts.from_csv("new_accounts.csv")
adaptive.accounts.update(accounts)
```
