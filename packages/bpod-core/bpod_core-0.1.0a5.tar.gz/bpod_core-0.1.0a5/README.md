# bpod-core

A Python library for communicating with the [*Bpod Finite State Machine*](https://sanworks.io/).

This project is maintained by the software development team at the
[*International Brain Lab*](https://internationalbrainlab.org/).

## Goals
* **Interface to Bpod Devices:** Provides an interface for interacting with Bpod devices.
* **State Machine Management:** Offers capabilities to define, validate, and run state machines.
* **Standalone or Library Use:** Can function independently or be integrated as a library within other projects.
* **Performance-Oriented:** Designed to be lean and fast.
* **Quality Assurance:** Typed, tested, and documented.

## Non-Goals
* **No GUI:** Does not include a graphical user interface.
* **Limited High-Level Functionality:** Does not provide features such as data management, configuration, or calibration.
* **No Specific Module Support:** Does not implement support for specific Bpod modules.
