"""SSL utilities for handling SSL-related issues in c4f.

This module provides utilities for handling SSL-related issues, particularly
the legacy SSL renegotiation error that can occur when connecting to APIs.

The main issue addressed is the "UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION_DISABLED" error
that occurs when connecting to certain APIs that still use legacy SSL renegotiation,
which is disabled by default in recent OpenSSL versions for security reasons.

Example:
    To apply the SSL workaround to a function that makes API calls:

    ```python
    from c4f.ssl_utils import with_ssl_workaround

    @with_ssl_workaround
    def my_api_function():
        # Make API calls here
        response = requests.get('https://api.example.com')
        return response.json()
    ```

Note:
    This workaround should be considered temporary. The proper solution is for
    the API provider to update their server configuration to not rely on legacy
    SSL renegotiation.
