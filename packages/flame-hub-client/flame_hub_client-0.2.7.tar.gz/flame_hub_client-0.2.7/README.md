# FLAME Hub Client

The FLAME Hub Client is a Python Client which wraps the endpoints of [FLAME Hub](https://github.com/PrivateAIM/hub)
API. This repository is part of the [PrivateAIM](https://privateaim.de/eng/index.html) project.

## Getting started

To install the client, Python 3.10 or higher is required.

```console
python -m pip install flame-hub-client
```

## Quickstart

The FLAME Hub Client offers *get*, *find*, *update*, *create* and *delete* methods for the core, storage and auth
endpoints. It is capable of authenticating against the API using either password or robot authentication. Pick one,
provide your credentials and plug them into the class for the service you want to use. Note that the client will
automatically reauthenticate if necessary.

```python
import flame_hub

auth = flame_hub.auth.PasswordAuth(
    username="admin", password="start123", base_url="http://localhost:3000/auth/"
)
auth_client = flame_hub.AuthClient(base_url="http://localhost:3000/auth/", auth=auth)
```

Now you're ready to use the library's functions! Start off with getting the so-called master realm by using one of the
*find* methods and filtering for the name `"master"`.

```python
master_realms = auth_client.find_realms(filter={"name": "master"})
```

Every *find* method returns a list of matching resources. Since there is only one realm called `"master"` in this
example, we simply pop it from the list and print the result.

```python
assert len(master_realms) == 1
master_realm = master_realms.pop()

print(master_realm.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

```console
{
  "name": "master",
  "display_name": null,
  "description": null,
  "id": "794f2375-f043-4789-bd0c-e5534e8deeaa",
  "built_in": true,
  "created_at": "2025-05-12T09:44:08.284000Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-05-12T09:44:08.284000Z"
}
```

Next we want to create a new node. Node resources are accessible over endpoints under the core directive. So the first
step is to create a new core client and then create a new node.

```python
core_client = flame_hub.CoreClient(base_url="http://localhost:3000/core/", auth=auth)
my_node = core_client.create_node(name="my-node", realm_id=master_realm)

print(my_node.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

```console
{
  "external_name": null,
  "hidden": false,
  "name": "my-node",
  "realm_id": "794f2375-f043-4789-bd0c-e5534e8deeaa",
  "registry_id": null,
  "type": "default",
  "id": "03636152-e6a8-4e01-994e-18b2b0c3a935",
  "public_key": null,
  "online": false,
  "registry": null,
  "registry_project_id": null,
  "registry_project": null,
  "robot_id": "200aab68-a686-407c-a6c1-2dd367ff6031",
  "created_at": "2025-05-19T15:43:57.859000Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-05-19T15:43:57.859000Z"
}
```

Maybe making the node public wasn't such a good idea, so let's update it by hiding it. To see if the update was
successful, we have to request the updated node from the Hub.

```python
core_client.update_node(my_node, hidden=True)

assert core_client.get_node(my_node.id) is True
```

To clean up our mess, we delete the node and verify that the node is gone forever.

```python
core_client.delete_node(my_node)

assert core_client.get_node(my_node.id) is None
```

Note that not all method types are implemented for each resource. Check out the
[documentation](https://privateaim.github.io/hub-python-client/) which methods are available.
