### Quick example on sending a message:

```python
from O365 import Account

credentials = ('client_id', 'client_secret')

account = Account(credentials)
m = account.new_message()
m.to.add('to_example@example.com')
m.subject = 'Testing!'
m.body = "George Best quote: I've stopped drinking, but only while I'm asleep."
m.send()
```


### Why choose O365?
- Almost Full Support for MsGraph Rest Api.
- Good Abstraction layer for the Api.
- Full oauth support with automatic handling of refresh tokens.
- Automatic handling between local datetimes and server datetimes. Work with your local datetime and let this library do the rest.
- Change between different resource with ease: access shared mailboxes, other users resources, SharePoint resources, etc.
- Pagination support through a custom iterator that handles future requests automatically. Request Infinite items!
- A query helper to help you build custom OData queries (filter, order, select and search).
- Modular ApiComponents can be created and built to achieve further functionality.

This project was also a learning resource for us. This is a list of not so common python idioms used in this project:
- New unpacking technics: `def method(argument, *, with_name=None, **other_params):`
- Enums: `from enum import Enum`
- Factory paradigm
- Package organization
- Timezone conversion and timezone aware datetimes
- Etc. ([see the code!](https://github.com/O365/python-o365/tree/master/O365))
