        Property that returns the rate of rotation around the device's local
        X, Y and Z axis.

        Along x-axis: angular speed around the X axis
        Along y-axis: angular speed around the Y axis
        Along z-axis: angular speed around the Z axis

        Returns (None, None, None) if no data is currently available.

        Property that returns the current rate of rotation around the X, Y and
        Z axis. An estimation of the drift on each axis is reported as well.

        Along x-axis: angular speed (w/o drift compensation) around the X axis
        Along y-axis: angular speed (w/o drift compensation) around the Y axis
        Along z-axis: angular speed (w/o drift compensation) around the Z axis

        Along y-axis: estimated drift around Y axis
        Along z-axis: estimated drift around Z axis
