class Proximity:
    '''Proximity facade.

    The proximity sensor is commonly used to determine distance whether
    phone is close to your head. Commonly is used when you have a call
    and you stick your phone with your head. Then screen of phone turns off.

    Use method `enable` to turn on proximity sensor and method `disable` for
    turn off.

    To check if some object (or your head) is near sensor check values from
    property `proximity`. It returns `True` when object is close.
