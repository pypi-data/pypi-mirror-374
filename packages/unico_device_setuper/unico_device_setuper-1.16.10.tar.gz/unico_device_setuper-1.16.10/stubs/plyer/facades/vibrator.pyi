class Vibrator:
    '''
    Vibration facade.
    '''
    def vibrate(self, time=...):
        '''
        Ask the vibrator to vibrate for the given period.

        :param time: Time to vibrate for, in seconds. Default is 1.
        '''
        ...
    
    def pattern(self, pattern=..., repeat=...):
        '''
        Ask the vibrator to vibrate with the given pattern, with an
        optional repeat.

        :param pattern: Pattern to vibrate with. Should be a list of
            times in seconds. The first number is how long to wait
            before vibrating, and subsequent numbers are times to
            vibrate and not vibrate alternately.
            Defaults to ``[0, 1]``.

        :param repeat: Index at which to repeat the pattern. When the
            vibration pattern reaches this index, it will start again
            from the beginning. Defaults to ``-1``, which means no
            repeat.
        '''

    def exists(self):
        '''
        Check if the device has a vibrator. Returns True or
        False.
        '''

    def cancel(self):
        '''
        Cancels any current vibration, and stops the vibrator.
