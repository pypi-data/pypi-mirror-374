TODO:
- test the new actin_number_types 
  with 3 and 5
  make sure it runs without errors and visualizes
- debug using raise Exception() or print() above each line that was errored at, next at 530. 
  - check where the actin_number_types is getting changed to 1 
  - @ line 823 in actin_generator.py, actin_number_types = 5 is used 
  - actin_number_types is probably getting changed in get_monomers bc its output that's being used in get_monomers_for_fiber (actin_number_types = 1)
  - actin_number_types is getting changed to 1 when get_monomers_for_fiber() is getting called in get_monomers() method. it’s happening bc get_monomers_for_fiber() takes 7 args (including actin_number_types) but in def get_monomers(), it’s only given 6 arguments so actin_number_types is being set to 1 (which is what is given for the particles arg, the default for particles is an empty dictionary) 
- run tests: `make build` from root of readdy-models
  add more test cases to test_actin_number_types.py
- add bonds: with offset of 2
   1 - 3
   3 - 5
   5 - 2
   2 - 4
   ActinUtil.add_bonds_between_actins()
     add util.add_polymer_bond_1D() for offsets 0 and 2
- test again
  make sure it runs without errors and visualizes
- for adding angles and dihedrals, talk to subcellular modeling group (esp Matt A)
- lucid chart
