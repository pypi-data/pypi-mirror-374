    predictions. It also allows for optional exclusion of the background class
    from the loss computation.

    Attributes:
        exclude_background: If True, the background class (class 0) is
            excluded from the loss computation.
        spatial_dims: Tuple indicating the spatial dimensions for 3D data.

        True, it removes the background class from both the ground truth and

        the correct dimensions and are compatible with each other.
