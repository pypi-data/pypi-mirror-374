# Contributing to Builder MCP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Builder MCP project! This guide will help you get started with development and testing.

## Development Setup

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package management and follows modern Python development practices.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for package management

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/airbytehq/connector-builder-mcp.git
   cd connector-builder-mcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   uv sync --all-extras
   # Or:
   poe sync
   ```

3. **Verify the installation**:

   ```bash
   uv run connector-builder-mcp --help
   ```

### Using Poe Tasks

For convenience, install [Poe the Poet](https://poethepoet.natn.io/) task runner:

```bash
# Install Poe
uv tool install poethepoet

# View all available commands
poe --help
```

Available Poe commands:

```bash
# Development
poe install         # Install dependencies
poe sync            # Alias for install

# Code quality
poe format          # Format code with ruff
poe lint            # Lint code with ruff  
poe lint-fix        # Lint and auto-fix issues
poe typecheck       # Type check with mypy
poe check           # Run all checks (lint + typecheck + test)

# Testing
poe test            # Run tests with verbose output
poe test-fast       # Run tests, stop on first failure

# MCP server operations
poe mcp-serve-local # Serve with STDIO transport
poe mcp-serve-http  # Serve over HTTP
poe mcp-serve-sse   # Serve over SSE
poe inspect         # Inspect available MCP tools

# Combined workflows
poe check           # Run lint + typecheck + test
```

You can see what any Poe task does by checking the `poe_tasks.toml` file at the root of the repo.

## Manual Commands (without Poe)

If you prefer to run commands directly with uv:

```bash
# Development
uv sync --all-extras                 # Install dependencies
uv run ruff format .                 # Format code
uv run ruff check .                  # Lint code
uv run mypy connector_builder_mcp    # Type checking
uv run pytest tests/ -v              # Run tests

# MCP server
uv run connector-builder-mcp         # Start server
poe inspect                          # Inspect tools
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests covering:

- **Server functionality**: MCP server initialization and tool registration
- **Connector builder tools**: Manifest validation, stream testing, and resolution
- **Utility functions**: Configuration filtering and validation

Run the full test suite:

```bash
poe test
# or
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

### Testing with Real Connectors

To test with actual Airbyte connector manifests:

1. Prepare a connector manifest (JSON format)
2. Use the MCP tools through the server or test them directly
3. Verify that validation, stream testing, and resolution work as expected

## Code Style

We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for both linting and formatting:

- **Line length**: 100 characters
- **Target Python version**: 3.10+
- **Import sorting**: Automatic with ruff
- **Type hints**: Required for all public functions

Before submitting changes:

```bash
poe check  # Runs formatting, linting, type checking, and tests
```

## MCP Tool Development

When adding new MCP tools:

1. **Add the tool function** in the appropriate module (e.g., `connector_builder_mcp/_connector_builder.py`)
2. **Use proper type annotations** with Pydantic models for complex inputs/outputs
3. **Register the tool** in the module's registration function
4. **Add comprehensive tests** covering success and failure cases
5. **Update documentation** if the tool adds new capabilities

### Tool Function Pattern

```python
from typing import Annotated
from pydantic import Field
from fastmcp import FastMCP

def my_new_tool(
    param: Annotated[
        str,
        Field(description="Description of the parameter"),
    ],
) -> MyResultModel:
    """Tool description for MCP clients.
    
    Args:
        param: Parameter description
        
    Returns:
        Result description
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass

def register_tools(app: FastMCP) -> None:
    """Register all tools with the FastMCP app."""
    app.tool()(my_new_tool)
```

## AI Ownership Focus

This project emphasizes **AI ownership** rather than AI assistance. When contributing:

- **Design for autonomy**: Tools should enable end-to-end AI control of connector building
- **Comprehensive error handling**: AI agents need clear error messages and recovery paths  
- **Structured outputs**: Use Pydantic models for consistent, parseable responses
- **Testing workflows**: Include tools that support automated testing and validation

## Submitting Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines
3. **Run the full test suite**: `poe check`
4. **Commit with clear messages**: Use conventional commit format
5. **Push and create a pull request**

### Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```text
feat: add new MCP tool for stream discovery
fix: resolve manifest validation edge case
docs: update contributing guidelines
test: add integration tests for connector builder
```
