    This function returns a float value between 0.0 and 1.0, where:
    - 1.0 means the strings are identical
    - 0.0 means the strings are completely different

    Args:
        a (str): The first string to compare.
        b (str): The second string to compare.

        float: A f64 value representing the similarity rate between the two input strings.

    Example:
