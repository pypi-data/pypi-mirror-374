3.6 Products have lifecycles and would eventually exit the market due to various factors such as market demand, technological innovation and development, the launch of more competitive products, etc. Considering the possible impact of product lifecycle termination on customer networks, Huawei Enterprise has developed a unified end of life policy to help customers better manage the transition due to product end-of-life and understand the role Huawei can play in assisting with migration to alternative platforms and technologies, and other high-quality products and services that Huawei can continue to provide to customers. Huawei product (including software) lifecycle regulation is subject to the Product End of Life Policy, which can refer to the URL address of Huawei’s official website: https://support.huawei.com/ecolumnsweb/en/warranty-policy.
3.7 One of Huawei’s key development strategies is to uphold the continuous construction and full implementation of the "end-to-end global cyber security assurance system."

Furthermore, Huawei continues to address challenges together with external stakeholders in an open manner. Huawei Vulnerability Management Principles can refer to the URL address of Huawei’s official website: https://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/vul-response-process.
3.8 Digital certificate technology is widely used as a means of authentication for communication encryption. Before two nodes in a network communicate securely, in order to avoid identity counterfeiting or man-in-the-middle attacks, the identity of the other end can be authenticated through digital certificates. Based on 3GPP, IETF and other standards, when the device is manufactured, Huawei will issue an initial certificate representing the identity of the supplier's device, which is used for the initial identity authentication of the device when it enters the customer's network. After the completion of the device into the network, the device and digital certificate management responsibilities are transferred to the customer, Huawei recommends that the customer replace the initial certificate used in the network device with the customer's own certificate, and based on the industry's best practices to use short-validity certificates, regular replacement of certificates, to reduce the risk of leakage of the private key of digital certificates and to avoid service interruption due to expiration of certificates. For details of the rights and responsibilities of Huawei device initial certificate, please refer to the following link：https://support.huawei.com/additionalres/pki “ Huawei Equipment Sub-CA Certification Practice Statement”.
