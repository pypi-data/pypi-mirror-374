# CLArena (Continual Learning Arena)

**An open-source machine learning package for continual learning research**

**CLArena (Continual Learning Arena)** is an open-source Python package designed for **Continual Learning (CL)** research, solely developed by myself. This package provides an integrated environment with extensive APIs for conducting CL experiments, along with pre-implemented algorithms and datasets that you can start using immediately. In addition to continual learning, CLArena also supports continual unlearning, mtlti-task learning, and single-task learning.
