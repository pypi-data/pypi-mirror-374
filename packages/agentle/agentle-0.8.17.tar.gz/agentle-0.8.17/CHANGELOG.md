## v0.8.12
- refactor(models): remove examples from audio element description fields

The examples in the field definitions were removed to simplify the model and reduce maintenance overhead, as they were not essential to the core functionality and could be documented separately if needed.

The example lists in field definitions were redundant as they were already covered in the description text. This change simplifies the model by removing duplicate information.
