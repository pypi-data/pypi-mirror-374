@dataclass()
class MesoscopeHardwareState(YamlConfig):
    """Stores configuration parameters (states) of the Mesoscope-VR system hardware modules used during training or
    experiment runtime.

    This information is used to read and decode the data saved to the .npz log files during runtime as part of data
    processing.

    Notes:
        This class stores 'static' Mesoscope-VR system configuration that does not change during experiment or training
        session runtime. This is in contrast to MesoscopeExperimentConfiguration class, which reflects the 'dynamic'
        state of the Mesoscope-VR system during each experiment.

        This class partially overlaps with the MesoscopeSystemConfiguration class, which is also stored in the
        raw_data folder of each session. The primary reason to keep both classes is to ensure that the math (rounding)
        used during runtime matches the math (rounding) used during data processing. MesoscopeSystemConfiguration does
        not do any rounding or otherwise attempt to be repeatable, which is in contrast to hardware modules that read
        and apply those parameters. Reading values from this class guarantees the read value exactly matches the value
        used during runtime.

    Notes:
        All fields in this dataclass initialize to None. During log processing, any log associated with a hardware
        module that provides the data stored in a field will be processed, unless that field is None. Therefore, setting
        any field in this dataclass to None also functions as a flag for whether to parse the log associated with the
        module that provides this field's information.

        This class is automatically configured by _MesoscopeVRSystem class from the sl-experiment library to facilitate
        proper log parsing.
