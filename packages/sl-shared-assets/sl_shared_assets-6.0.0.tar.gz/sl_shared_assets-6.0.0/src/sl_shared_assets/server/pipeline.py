    conditions. It is also used to evaluate the status (success / failure) of each pipeline as they are executed by the
    remote server.

    Note:
        This instance frequently refers to the 'manager process' in method documentation. A 'manager process' is the
        highest-level process that manages the tracked pipeline. When a pipeline runs on remote compute servers, the
        manager process is typically the process running on the non-server machine (user PC) that submits the remote
        processing jobs to the compute server. The worker process(es) that run the processing job(s) on the remote
        compute servers are not considered manager processes.

        The processing trackers work similar to 'lock' files. When a pipeline starts running on the remote server, its
        tracker is switched into the 'running' (locked) state until the pipeline completes, aborts, or encounters an
        error. When the tracker is locked, all modifications to the tracker have to originate from the same manager
        process that started the pipeline. This feature supports running complex processing pipelines that use multiple
        concurrent and / or sequential processing jobs on the remote server.

    automatically handles all interactions with the server necessary to run the remote processing pipeline and
    verify the runtime outcome via the runtime_cycle() method that has to be called cyclically until the pipeline is

        each instance contains the necessary data to run the entire processing pipeline.

        of other jobs, they are organized into stages based on the dependency graph between jobs. Combined with cluster
