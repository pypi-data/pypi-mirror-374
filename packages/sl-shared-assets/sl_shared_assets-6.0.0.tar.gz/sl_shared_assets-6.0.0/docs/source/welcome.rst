Welcome to sl-shared-assets API documentation page

sl-shared-assets is a Python library that provides data acquisition and processing assets shared between Sun (NeuroAI)
lab libraries.

This library is developed in the `Sun lab <https://neuroai.github.io/sunlab/>`_ at Cornell University. The main purpose
of this library is to provide the tools and assets used by multiple other data acquisition and processing libraries in
the lab to avoid dependency collisions.
