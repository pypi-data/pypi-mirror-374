# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of
a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

<!--
  Hi! Thanks for considering to file a feature request with {project_name}. Please take the time to
  answer the basic questions. Please try to be as detailed as possible.

  Thanks!
-->

## Summary

<!--
  A one-paragraph explanation of the feature.
-->

## Motivation

<!--
  Why do you want to see this feature in {project_name}? What use cases does it support?
-->

## Guide-level explanation

<!--
  Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the project and you
  were teaching it to another programmer. That generally means:

  - Introducing new named concepts.
  - Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
  - If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or
    migration guidance.

  If this is a small feature, you may omit this section.
-->

## Reference-level explanation

<!--
  This is the technical portion of the feature request. Explain the design in
  sufficient detail that:

  - Its interaction with other features is clear.
  - It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
  - Corner cases are dissected by example.

  If you do not know how to answer this, you can omit it. No worries!
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
  Why should we *not* do this?
-->

## Unresolved Questions

<!--
  What related issues do you consider out of scope for this feature that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  feature?
