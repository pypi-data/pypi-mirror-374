# Archer CLI

Archer is a Rich-powered, cancellable TUI/CLI assistant that integrates with the Anthropic API and provides a tool-calling workflow.

## Features
- Beautiful Rich UI with footer and status lines
- Cancellable operations: press ESC while processing
- Tooling: read files, list files, bash, search, and edit files

## Installation
```
pip install archer-cli
```

## Usage
```
archer
```

## Custom Slash Commands

Add project-specific commands by placing markdown files under `.archer/commands` in your repo root. The filename becomes the command name. Example:

```
.archer/commands/security_review.md
```

Frontmatter and body format:

```
---
title: Security Review
description: run this when we need a security review
---

You're goal is security review. Review the solution and try to find security issues.
```

Usage:

- Run `/security_review` (optional args appended will be passed as context).
- The file body is injected into the conversation and processed like a normal request.
- These custom commands appear in the `/` dropdown with their `description`.

## Development
- Python >= 3.10
- See `read.py` for the current entrypoint; packaging wraps this via `src/archer_cli/cli.py`.
