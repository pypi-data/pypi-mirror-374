    Parameters
    ----------
    f : Callable[[F64Array, F64Array], F64Array]
        Function to be fitted, with the signature `f(x, beta)`. It must return
        an array with the same shape as `y`.
    xdata : F64Array
        Array of shape `(n,)` or `(m, n)` containing the observed values of the
        explanatory variable(s).
    ydata : F64Array
        Array of shape `(n,)` or `(q, n)` containing the observed values of the
        response variable(s). When the model is explicit, `ydata` must contain
        a value for each observation. To ignore specific values (e.g., missing
        data), set the corresponding entry in `weight_y` to zero. When the model
        is implicit, `ydata` is not used (but must be defined).
    beta0 : F64Array
        Array of shape `(npar,)` with the initial guesses of the model parameters,
        within the optional bounds specified by `bounds`.
    weight_x : float | F64Array | None
        Scalar or array specifying how the errors on `xdata` are to be weighted.
        If `weight_x` is a scalar, then it is used for all data points. If
        `weight_x` is an array of shape `(n,)` and `m==1`, then `weight_x[i]`
        represents the weight for `xdata[i]`. If `weight_x` is an array of shape
        `(m,)`, then it represents the diagonal of the covariant weighting matrix
        for all data points. If `weight_x` is an array of shape `(m, m)`, then
        it represents the full covariant weighting matrix for all data points.
        If `weight_x` is an array of shape `(m, n)`, then `weight_x[:, i]`
        represents the diagonal of the covariant weighting matrix for `xdata[:, i]`.
        If `weight_x` is an array of shape `(m, m, n)`, then `weight_x[:, :, i]`
        represents the full covariant weighting matrix for `xdata[:, i]`. For a
        comprehensive description of the options, refer to page 26 of the
        ODRPACK95 guide. By default, `weight_x` is set to one for all `xdata`
        points.
    weight_y : float | F64Array | None
        Scalar or array specifying how the errors on `ydata` are to be weighted.
        If `weight_y` is a scalar, then it is used for all data points. If
        `weight_y` is an array of shape `(n,)` and `q==1`, then `weight_y[i]`
        represents the weight for `ydata[i]`. If `weight_y` is an array of shape
        `(q,)`, then it represents the diagonal of the covariant weighting matrix
        for all data points. If `weight_y` is an array of shape `(q, q)`, then
        it represents the full covariant weighting matrix for all data points.
        If `weight_y` is an array of shape `(q, n)`, then `weight_y[:, i]`
        represents the diagonal of the covariant weighting matrix for `ydata[:, i]`.
        If `weight_y` is an array of shape `(q, q, n)`, then `weight_y[:, :, i]`
        represents the full covariant weighting matrix for `ydata[:, i]`. For a
        comprehensive description of the options, refer to page 25 of the
        ODRPACK95 guide. By default, `weight_y` is set to one for all `ydata`
        points.
    bounds : tuple[F64Array | None, F64Array | None] | None
        Tuple of arrays with the same shape as `beta0`, specifying the lower and
        upper bounds of the model parameters. The first array contains the lower
        bounds, and the second contains the upper bounds. By default, the bounds
        are set to negative and positive infinity, respectively, for all elements
        of `beta`.
    task : Literal['explicit-ODR', 'implicit-ODR', 'OLS']
        Specifies the regression task to be performed. `'explicit-ODR'` solves
        an orthogonal distance regression problem with an explicit model.
        `'implicit-ODR'` handles models defined implicitly. `'OLS'` performs
        ordinary least squares fitting.
    fix_beta : BoolArray | None
        Array with the same shape as `beta0`, specifying which elements of `beta`
        are to be held fixed. `True` means the parameter is fixed; `False` means
        it is adjustable. By default, all elements of `beta` are set to `False`.
    fix_x : BoolArray | None
        Array with the same shape as `xdata`, specifying which elements of `xdata`
        are to be held fixed. Alternatively, it can be a rank-1 array of shape
        `(m,)` or `(n,)`, in which case it will be broadcast along the other
        axis. `True` means the element is fixed; `False` means it is adjustable.
        By default, in orthogonal distance regression mode, all elements of 
        `fix_x` are set to `False`. In ordinary least squares mode (`task='OLS'`),
        all `xdata` values are automatically treated as fixed.
    jac_beta : Callable[[F64Array, F64Array], F64Array] | None
        Jacobian of the function to be fitted with respect to `beta`, with the
        signature `jac_beta(x, beta)`. It must return an array with shape 
        `(q, npar, n)` or a compatible shape. By default, the Jacobian is
        approximated numerically using the finite difference scheme specified
        by `diff_scheme`.
    jac_x : Callable[[F64Array, F64Array], F64Array] | None
        Jacobian of the function to be fitted with respect to `x`, with the
        signature `jac_x(x, beta)`. It must return an array with shape 
        `(q, m, n)` or a compatible shape. By default, the Jacobian is approximated
        numerically using the finite difference scheme specified by `diff_scheme`.
    delta0 : F64Array | None
        Array with the same shape as `xdata`, containing the initial guesses of 
        the errors in the explanatory variable. By default, `delta0` is set to
        zero for all elements of `xdata`.
    diff_scheme : Literal['forward', 'central']
        Finite difference scheme used to approximate the Jacobian matrices when
        the user does not provide `jac_beta` and `jac_x`. The default method is
        forward differences. Central differences are generally more accurate but
        require one additional `f` evaluation per partial derivative.
    report : Literal['none', 'short', 'long', 'iteration']
        Specifies the level of computation reporting. `'none'` disables all output.
        `'short'` prints a brief initial and final summary. `'long'` provides a 
        detailed initial and final summary. `'iteration'` outputs information at
        each iteration step in addition to the detailed summaries. This is 
        useful for debugging or monitoring progress.
    maxit : int | None
        Maximum number of allowed iterations.
    ndigit : int | None
        Number of reliable decimal digits in the values computed by the model
        function `f` and its Jacobians `jac_beta`, and `jac_x`. By default,
        the value is numerically determined by evaluating `f`. 
    taufac : float | None
        Factor ranging from 0 to 1 to initialize the trust region radius. The
        default value is 1. Reducing `taufac` may be appropriate if, at the
        first iteration, the computed results for the full Gauss-Newton step
        cause an overflow, or cause `beta` and/or `delta` to leave the region
        of interest. 
    sstol : float | None
        Factor ranging from 0 to 1 specifying the stopping tolerance for the
        sum of the squares convergence. The default value is `eps**(1/2)`,
        where `eps` is the machine precision in `float64`.
    partol : float | None
        Factor ranging from 0 to 1 specifying the stopping tolerance for
        parameter convergence (i.e., `beta` and `delta`). When the model is
        explicit, the default value is `eps**(2/3)`, and when the model is
        implicit, the default value is `eps**(1/3)`, where `eps` is the machine
        precision in `float64`.
    step_beta : F64Array | None
        Array with the same shape as `beta0` containing the _relative_ step
        sizes used to compute the finite difference derivatives with respect
        to the model parameters. By default, the step size is set internally 
        based on the value of `ndigit` and the type of finite differences
        specified by `diff_scheme`. For additional details, refer to pages 31
        and 78 of the ODRPACK95 guide.
    step_delta : F64Array | None
        Array with the same shape as `xdata`, containing the _relative_ step 
        sizes used to compute the finite difference derivatives with respect to
        the errors in the explanatory variable. Alternatively, it can be a rank-1
        array of shape `(m,)` or `(n,)`, in which case it will be broadcast along
        the other axis. By default, step size is set internally based on the value
        of `ndigit` and the type of finite differences specified by `diff_scheme`.
        For additional details, refer to pages 31 and 78 of the ODRPACK95 guide.
    scale_beta : F64Array | None
        Array with the same shape as `beta0` containing the scale values of the
        model parameters. Scaling is used to improve the numerical stability
        of the regression, but does not affect the problem specification. Scaling
        should not be confused with the weighting matrices `weight_x` and 
        `weight_y`. By default, the scale is set internally based on the relative
        magnitudes of `beta`. For further details, refer to pages 32 and 84 of
        the ODRPACK95 guide.
    scale_delta : F64Array | None
        Array with the same shape as `xdata`, containing the scale values of the
        errors in the explanatory variable. Alternatively, it can be a rank-1
        array of shape `(m,)` or `(n,)`, in which case it will be broadcast along
        the other axis. Scaling is used to improve the numerical stability of
        the regression, but does not affect the problem specification. Scaling
        should not be confused with the weighting matrices `weight_x` and 
        `weight_y`. By default, the scale is set internally based on the relative
        magnitudes of `xdata`. For further details, refer to pages 32 and 85 of
        the ODRPACK95 guide.
    rptfile : str | None
        File name for storing the computation reports, as defined by `report`.
        By default, the reports are sent to standard output.
    errfile : str | None
        File name for storing the error reports, as defined by `report`. By
        default, the reports are sent to standard output.
