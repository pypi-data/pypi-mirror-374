### Popular patterns

- SaaS SSE/HTTP servers for product data (e.g., docs, tickets)
- Local stdio servers for CLIs/databases
- Composite agents with multiple servers (fetch, search, storage)

### Multi‑server agents

Combine multiple servers on a single agent and constrain path with assertions:

```python
from mcp_eval.catalog import Expect

await session.assert_that(Expect.tools.sequence(["search", "fetch"]))
await session.assert_that(Expect.path.efficiency(expected_tool_sequence=["search","fetch"]))
```

### Server discovery and drift

- Use `mcp-eval server list -v` in CI to detect missing tools.
- Add an `Expect.tools.count(tool, >=1)` guard to ensure expected calls happen.

### Security

- Store credentials in CI secrets / local secrets file.
- Avoid writing secrets in `mcp.json` or DXT.
