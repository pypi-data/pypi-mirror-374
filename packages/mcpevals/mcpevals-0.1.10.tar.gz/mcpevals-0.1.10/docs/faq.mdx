### Does server language matter?

No. Any language works as long as your server implements MCP. mcp-eval drives it via the agent and MCP transport.

### How do I add servers quickly?

Use `mcp-eval server add` or import from `mcp.json` / DXT. See [Quickstart](./quickstart) and [CLI Reference](./cli-reference).

### Decorator order?

Place `@with_agent(...)` above `@task(...)` when used together.

### Can I run without an LLM?

Yes for tool/structural checks that donâ€™t require generation. LLM judge assertions need an LLM.

### How do I run a specific test or dataset?

`mcp-eval run tests/test_file.py::test_func` or `mcp-eval run dataset path.yaml`.

### Where are configs discovered?

[config.py](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-eval/blob/main/src/mcp_eval/config.py) documents discovery for `mcpeval.yaml` and secrets.

{/* TODO: Add a short video/GIF explaining the high-level workflow and where each file lives. */}

### Parallel datasets?

`Dataset.evaluate(..., max_concurrency=N)` enables parallel case execution.
