A `.pylintrc` file is a configuration file used by Pylint to customize code analysis in Python projects. It allows developers to define specific coding standards, enable or disable certain checks, adjust error and warning levels, and set formatting rules such as line length or naming conventions. By using a `.pylintrc` file, teams can maintain consistent code quality and enforce style guidelines across their projects.
