A `pyproject.toml` file is a standardized configuration file for Python projects. It defines essential project metadata (such as name, version, authors, and license) and specifies build system requirements, dependencies, and optional tools or plugins. By centralizing this information, `pyproject.toml` makes packaging, building, and managing Python projects more consistent across different tools. It is widely supported by modern Python packaging tools like pip, setuptools, and Poetry, and helps ensure that projects are easier to build, distribute, and maintain.
