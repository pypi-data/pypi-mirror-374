A `.gitignore` file is used in Git to specify which files and directories should be excluded from version control. This helps keep repositories clean by ignoring files that are automatically generated, system-specific, or not meant to be shared (such as build artifacts, dependency caches, log files, and temporary editor settings). By defining patterns in the `.gitignore`, developers ensure that only relevant source code and project files are tracked, making collaboration and repository management more efficient.
