A `license` is a legal document that defines how others can use, share, and modify your work. In software development, licenses clarify the rights granted to users and set conditions for distribution, collaboration, and reuse. They help protect creators by limiting liability while also encouraging open-source contributions or controlling commercial use, depending on the chosen `license`. By including a `license`, developers ensure their projects are used responsibly and consistently with their intentions.
