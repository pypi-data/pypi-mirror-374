A `pylint.yml` file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration used to automate code quality checks for Python projects. It defines steps that run Pylint, a static code analysis tool, on your codebase whenever events like pushes or pull requests occur. The workflow typically sets up Python, installs dependencies, and runs Pylint to detect errors, enforce coding standards, and ensure consistent style. Using a `pylint.yml` workflow helps maintain code quality, catch potential bugs early, and enforce team-wide coding conventions automatically.
