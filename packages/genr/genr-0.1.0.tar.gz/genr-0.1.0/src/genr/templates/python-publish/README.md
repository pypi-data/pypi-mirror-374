A `python-publish.yml` file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration used to automate the publishing of Python packages. It defines a series of steps that run whenever certain events occur, such as pushing a tag or merging into the main branch. Typically, the workflow includes actions to set up Python, install dependencies, run tests, build the package (e.g., using setuptools or poetry), and publish it to package repositories like PyPI or TestPyPI. By using `python-publish.yml`, developers can streamline releases, ensure consistency, and reduce manual errors when distributing Python packages.
