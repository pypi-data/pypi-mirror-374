# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project!

We provide a guide for contributors. If you are reading this locally or directly on GitHub, check the following documents:

- Contributors guide: [docs/guide/contributors.md](docs/guide/contributors.md)
    - Environment setup: [docs/guide/contributors/setup.md](docs/guide/contributors/setup.md)
    - Management commands: [docs/guide/contributors/commands.md](docs/guide/contributors/commands.md)
    - Development workflow: [docs/guide/contributors/workflow.md](docs/guide/contributors/workflow.md)
    - Project architecture: [docs/guide/contributors/architecture.md](docs/guide/contributors/architecture.md)

We strongly recommend reading the online version at https://mkdocstrings.github.io/griffe/guide/contributors/, as some content is dynamically generated when building the documentation pages.
