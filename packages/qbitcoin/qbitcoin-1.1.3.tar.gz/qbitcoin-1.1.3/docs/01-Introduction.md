- **RESTful APIs**: Complete API access for developers

### üåê Network Architecture
- **Peer-to-Peer Network**: Decentralized node communication
- **Mining Support**: Solo and pool mining capabilities
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live blockchain and network statistics

## Core Concepts

### Addresses and Keys
- **Falcon-512 Keys**: Each wallet uses post-quantum cryptographic keys
- **Address Format**: Addresses start with 'Q' followed by encoded public key
- **Key Sizes**: Public keys are 897 bytes, private keys are 1281 bytes

### Transactions
- **Transfer Transactions**: Send QBIT coins between addresses
- **Token Transactions**: Create and transfer custom tokens
- **Multi-Signature Transactions**: Require multiple signatures for authorization
- **Message Transactions**: Embed messages in the blockchain

### Mining
- **Proof-of-Work**: Uses computational puzzles to secure the network
- **Block Rewards**: Miners receive QBIT for successfully mining blocks
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Network automatically adjusts mining difficulty
- **Solo and Pool Mining**: Multiple mining options available

## Why Qbitcoin?

### Quantum Security
Traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use ECDSA signatures, which are vulnerable to quantum computer attacks. Qbitcoin uses Falcon-512, a NIST-approved post-quantum signature scheme that remains secure even against quantum computers.

### Developer Friendly
Built with Python and modern frameworks, Qbitcoin is easy to understand, modify, and extend. The codebase includes comprehensive documentation and examples.

### Future-Ready
As quantum computing technology advances, cryptocurrencies will need quantum-resistant security. Qbitcoin is built from the ground up with this future in mind.
