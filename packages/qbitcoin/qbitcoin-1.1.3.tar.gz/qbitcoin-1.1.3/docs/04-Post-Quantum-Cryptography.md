# Post-Quantum Cryptography in Qbitcoin

This guide explains the post-quantum cryptographic features that make Qbitcoin quantum-resistant.

## What is Post-Quantum Cryptography?

Post-quantum cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms that are secure against attacks by both classical and quantum computers. Traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), which can be broken by sufficiently powerful quantum computers using Shor's algorithm.

### The Quantum Threat

**Classical computers** would need millions of years to break current cryptographic systems.

**Quantum computers** could potentially break these systems in hours or days using:
- **Shor's Algorithm**: Breaks RSA and elliptic curve cryptography
- **Grover's Algorithm**: Reduces security of hash functions by half

### Why Qbitcoin is Different

Qbitcoin implements quantum-resistant algorithms that remain secure even against quantum computers, ensuring your cryptocurrency is future-proof.

## Qbitcoin's Cryptographic Stack

### 1. FALCON Digital Signatures

Qbitcoin uses **FALCON** (Fast-Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU) for digital signatures.

#### Key Features
- **Quantum-resistant**: Based on lattice problems that are hard for quantum computers
- **Compact signatures**: Smaller than many post-quantum alternatives
- **Fast verification**: Efficient signature verification process
- **NIST standardized**: Part of NIST's post-quantum cryptography standards

#### Technical Specifications
```
Security Level: NIST Level 1 (equivalent to AES-128)
Signature Size: ~690 bytes (FALCON-512)
Public Key Size: ~897 bytes
Private Key Size: ~1,281 bytes
```

### 2. Hash-Based Addresses

Qbitcoin addresses are derived using quantum-resistant hash functions:

#### Address Generation Process
1. **Public Key Generation**: Create FALCON public/private key pair
2. **Hash Function**: Apply SHA-256 to public key
3. **Address Encoding**: Encode with base58check and Qbitcoin prefix

#### Example Address Structure
```
Public Key (FALCON) → SHA-256 → Base58Check → qbitcoin1...
```

### 3. Merkle Tree Signatures (Future)

Planned implementation of hash-based signatures for additional quantum resistance:
- **XMSS** (eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme)
- **SPHINCS+** for stateless signatures

## How FALCON Works

### Mathematical Foundation

FALCON is based on the **NTRU lattice problem**, which involves:

1. **Lattice-based cryptography**: Uses mathematical structures called lattices
2. **Ring-Learning with Errors**: A specific type of lattice problem
3. **Gaussian sampling**: Advanced mathematical technique for signature generation

### Signature Process

#### Key Generation
```python
# Simplified representation
private_key = generate_falcon_private_key()
public_key = derive_public_key(private_key)
```

#### Signing Process
```python
def sign_transaction(message, private_key):
    # 1. Hash the message
    hash_msg = sha256(message)
    
    # 2. Generate FALCON signature
    signature = falcon_sign(hash_msg, private_key)
    
    return signature
```

#### Verification Process
```python
def verify_signature(message, signature, public_key):
    # 1. Hash the message
    hash_msg = sha256(message)
    
    # 2. Verify FALCON signature
    is_valid = falcon_verify(hash_msg, signature, public_key)
    
    return is_valid
```

## Quantum Resistance Analysis

### Security Levels

| Algorithm | Classical Security | Quantum Security | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| ECDSA (Bitcoin) | 128-bit | ~0-bit | ❌ Vulnerable |
| RSA-2048 | 112-bit | ~0-bit | ❌ Vulnerable |
| FALCON-512 | 128-bit | 128-bit | ✅ Quantum-safe |
| SHA-256 | 256-bit | 128-bit | ✅ Quantum-resistant |

### Attack Resistance

#### Against Classical Computers
- FALCON signatures require solving lattice problems
- Best known classical attacks need exponential time
- Security equivalent to AES-128

#### Against Quantum Computers
- No known quantum algorithms efficiently solve lattice problems
- Grover's algorithm provides only quadratic speedup against hash functions
- Maintains full security against quantum attacks

## Practical Implementation

### Wallet Security

#### Key Storage
```yaml
# Wallet structure
wallet:
  version: "1.0"
  type: "FALCON"
  private_key: "encrypted_falcon_private_key"
  public_key: "falcon_public_key"
  addresses:
    - "qbitcoin1abc123..."
    - "qbitcoin1def456..."
```

#### Address Generation
```python
# Generate new quantum-safe address
def generate_qbitcoin_address():
    # Generate FALCON key pair
    private_key, public_key = falcon.generate_keypair()
    
    # Hash public key
    pubkey_hash = sha256(public_key)
    
    # Create address with Qbitcoin prefix
    address = base58check_encode("qbitcoin", pubkey_hash)
    
    return address, private_key
```

### Transaction Signing

#### Creating Quantum-Safe Transactions
```python
def create_transaction(sender_key, recipient_addr, amount):
    # Create transaction data
    tx_data = {
        'from': sender_address,
        'to': recipient_addr,
        'amount': amount,
        'timestamp': current_time()
    }
    
    # Sign with FALCON
    signature = falcon.sign(serialize(tx_data), sender_key)
    
    # Add signature to transaction
    tx_data['signature'] = signature
    
    return tx_data
```
