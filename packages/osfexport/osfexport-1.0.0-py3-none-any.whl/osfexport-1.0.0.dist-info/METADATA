# OSF Project Exporter

This is a CLI tool for exporting research project data and files from the [OSF website](https://osf.io/). This is to prototype tool to export projects from the OSF website to a PDF, allowing users to back up, share or document their OSF projects in an offline medium.

## Development Setup

### Virtual Environment

1. Clone this repository onto your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment to install dependencies. For `virtualenv` this is done with ``virtualenv <myenvname>``. Make sure your virtual environment is setup to use Python 3.12 or above (e.g., ``virtualenv <myenvname> --python="/usr/bin/python3.12"`` on Linux.)
3. From local Git repo: Activate your virtual environment and run ``pip install -e osfexport`` to install this repository as a modifiable package. Then install other requirements separately via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. On the OSF website, create or log in to your account.  Set up a personal access token (PAT) by going into your account settings, select `Personal access tokens` in the left side menu, and clicking `Create token`. You should give the token a name that helps you remember why you made it, like "PDF export", and choose the `osf.full_read` scope - this allows this token to read all public and private projects on your account. You can delete this token once you have finished exporting your projects.

## Installation

### From PyPI: releases 0.1.4 and onwards

Activate your virtual environment: for example, using `virtualenv` this is done by:

- `source <myenvname>/bin/activate` on Linux
- `<myenvname>\Scripts\activate` on Windows/Mac

Next, run `python -m pip install osfexport`. This will download and install this package and other dependencies from the PyPI index.

## Usage

- Run `osfexport` to get a list of basic commands you can use.
- To see what a command needs as input, type `--help` after the command name (e.g. `osfexport welcome --help`; `osfexport --help`)
- To export all your projects from the OSF into a PDF, run `osfexport projects`.
