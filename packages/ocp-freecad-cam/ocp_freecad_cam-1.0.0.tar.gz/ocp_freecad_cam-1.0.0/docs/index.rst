Welcome to ocp-freecad-cam's documentation!
===========================================

oc-freecad-cam exposes FreeCAD's Path workbench in a fluent python API that takes
OCP TopoDS_Shape objects and their wrappers from CadQuery and Build123d to enable generating
parametric tool paths from the comfort of your keyboard.

Please see the [README.md](https://github.com/voneiden/ocp-freecad-cam) for most up to date notes
