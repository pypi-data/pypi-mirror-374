  "description": "AS7262 is a spectral sensor that measures light intensity across 6 specific wavelengths (450nm, 500nm, 550nm, 570nm, 590nm, 610nm). It provides high-accuracy spectral analysis for color identification, material analysis, and light quality assessment. The sensor uses I2C communication and includes configurable integration time and gain settings for optimal performance in different lighting conditions.",
