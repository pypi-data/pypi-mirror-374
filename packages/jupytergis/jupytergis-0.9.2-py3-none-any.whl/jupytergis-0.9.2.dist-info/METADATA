## Features

- **Collaborative GIS Environment**: Work together on geographic data projects in real-time.
- **QGIS File Support**: Load, visualize, and manipulate QGIS project files (`.qgs`, `.qgz`), and other GIS data formats.
- **Interactive Maps**: Render interactive maps and geospatial visualizations within Jupyter notebooks using the JupyterGIS Python API.

## [ðŸª„ Try JupyterGIS now! âœ¨](https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lite/lab/index.html?path=france_hiking.jGIS)

This demo runs a JupyterLab instance entirely in your browser with WebAssembly! ðŸ¤¯

Powered by [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/?badge=latest).
Please note that [JupyterGIS' real-time collaboration features are not yet supported in JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/configure/rtc.html).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- JupyterLab (version 3.0 or higher)
- (OPTIONAL) QGIS installed on your system and its Python modules available in the PATH. e.g. `mamba install --channel conda-forge qgis`

### Installing JupyterGIS

#### From PyPI

```bash
python -m pip install jupytergis
```

#### From conda-forge

JupyterGIS is also packaged and distributed on [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/jupytergis-packages-feedstock).

To install and add JupyterGIS to a project with [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh/), from the project directory run

```
pixi add jupytergis
```

and to install into a particular conda environment with [`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/), in the activated environment run

```
mamba install --channel conda-forge jupytergis
```

#### With Docker

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/geojupyter/jupytergis:latest
```

Replace `latest` with a specific version number if you prefer.
Docker build source is at <https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis-docker>.
