This module extends Field Service (FSM) functionality by automatically assigning FSM tags to orders based on product template tags.

**Features:**
- Automatically assigns FSM tags to open FSM orders based on products in linked stock moves.
- Ensures missing FSM tags are created dynamically.
- Supports manual tag assignment without being overwritten.
