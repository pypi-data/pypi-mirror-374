class NodeSelector:
    """
    A class to select nodes from a graph based on specific criteria.

    This class provides functionality to select a subset of nodes from a total number of nodes
    using different strategies. Currently, only the "random without replacement" strategy is implemented.

    Attributes:
    - num_total_nodes (int): The total number of nodes in the graph.
    - num_select_nodes (int): The number of nodes to select.
    - fraction (float): The fraction of nodes to select.
    - strategy (str): The strategy used for node selection.
    - selected_nodes (list): The list of selected nodes.

        """
        Initializes the NodeSelector object.

        Parameters:
        - total_nodes (int, optional): The total number of nodes in the graph. Must be a positive integer.
        - graph (nx.Graph, optional): A NetworkX graph object. Either total_nodes or graph must be provided, not both.
        - strategy (str, optional): The strategy used for node selection. Currently implements "random_uniform_wo_repl".

        Raises:
        - ValueError: If both total_nodes and graph are provided, or if neither is provided.
        - TypeError: If total_nodes is not an integer or if graph is not a NetworkX graph.
        - ValueError: If total_nodes is not a positive integer.

        ToDo: let the method also accept adjacency matrices (np.ndarray)
