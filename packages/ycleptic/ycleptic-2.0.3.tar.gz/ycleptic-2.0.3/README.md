# Ycleptic
> YAML configuration generator

YAML is a popular markup language for input files, with its easy syntax and clear
mapping to lists and dicts.  Ycleptic allows a developer to specify all keys, datatypes,
default values, choice restrictions, and other features of YAML-format input 
files for use in their own apps. This makes the specification of input file syntax on top 
of YAML for any particular application a bit easier than just using pure YAML.  In addition,
ycleptic can also automatically build the RST/Sphinx doctree for your app's configuration
file.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ycleptic
```

Once installed, the developer has access to the ``Yclept`` class.
