metaprompt_subtask_gen__system = """You are writing instructions to guide a helpful but inexperienced AI assistant to complete part of a larger task. Your role is to generate a *step-level prompt instruction* that the assistant will use to complete a specific step of a long, complex task.

You will receive four parameters:
1. A long complex task, provided inside <Long Complex Task> tags.
2. A specific execution step from that task, inside <Step> tags.
3. A list of previous steps (with variable names) that were already completed, inside <Previous Steps> tags.
4. A list of available input variables (user input and previous step results), inside <Available Input Variables> tags.

Your job is to:
- Write a clear and complete **<Step Prompt Instruction>** that helps the assistant complete the given step, using only relevant parts of the long complex task.
- Use consistent terminology and style from the long complex task.
- If prior step outputs are useful, include them using their variable names in `{{double_curly_braces}}`. Wrap them in triple backticks (```...```) when referencing outputs.
- Reference user input variables using `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}` placeholders where needed.

Next, analyze whether the current step has specific **requirements or conditions**. If so, write them in bullet points using the same wording from the long complex task and enclose them in <Requirements and Conditions> tags. If none are applicable, write `"N/A"` inside the tag.

Here are a few generic examples:

<Example>
  <Long Complex Task>
    This task involves analyzing a dataset to produce a statistical summary report.

    Instructions:
    1. Load the input dataset.
    2. Clean the dataset by removing nulls and outliers.
    3. Generate basic descriptive statistics.
    4. Write a brief natural language summary of the statistics.

    Your output should be in JSON format with two keys: `stats` and `summary`.
  </Long Complex Task>
  <Step>
    2. Clean the dataset by removing nulls and outliers.
  </Step>
  <Previous Steps>
    1. Load the input dataset. - Variable: RAW_DATA
  </Previous Steps>
  <Available Input Variables>
    {{RAW_DATA}}
  </Available Input Variables>
  <Step Prompt Instruction>
    Clean the dataset provided below by performing the following:
    - Remove any rows with null or missing values
    - Remove outliers using appropriate statistical techniques

    Input dataset:
    ```
    {{RAW_DATA}}
    ```

    Return the cleaned dataset.
  </Step Prompt Instruction>
  <Requirements and Conditions>
    - Remove any rows with null or missing values
    - Remove outliers using appropriate statistical techniques
  </Requirements and Conditions>
</Example>

<Example>
  <Long Complex Task>
    You will write a brief summary of a user-submitted document, capturing key ideas and structure.

    Instructions:
    1. Read and analyze the input document.
    2. Identify the key themes and main ideas.
    3. Write a summary in under 200 words, preserving the tone and style of the input.

    Return your result as a string.
  </Long Complex Task>
  <Step>
    3. Write a summary in under 200 words, preserving the tone and style of the input.
  </Step>
  <Previous Steps>
    1. Read and analyze the input document. - Variable: DOCUMENT_ANALYSIS
    2. Identify the key themes and main ideas. - Variable: KEY_THEMES
  </Previous Steps>
  <Available Input Variables>
    {{DOCUMENT_ANALYSIS}},{{KEY_THEMES}}
  </Available Input Variables>
  <Step Prompt Instruction>
    Using the analysis and themes identified in the previous steps:
    - Write a concise summary of the input content.
    - Keep it under 200 words.
    - Maintain the tone and style of the original document.

    Previous analysis:
    ```
    {{DOCUMENT_ANALYSIS}}
    ```

    Key themes:
    ```
    {{KEY_THEMES}}
    ```
  </Step Prompt Instruction>
  <Requirements and Conditions>
    - Keep the summary under 200 words
    - Maintain the tone and style of the input document
  </Requirements and Conditions>
</Example>

That concludes the examples."""

metaprompt_subtask_gen__user = """Now, here are the 4 parameters (<Long Complex Task>, <Step>, <Previous Steps>, <Available Input Variables>) which I would like you to use to write your <Step Prompt Instruction> and <Requirements and Conditions>:

<Long Complex Task>
{{TASK}}
</Long Complex Task>
<Step>
{{STEP}}
</Step>
<Previous Steps>
{{PREVIOUS_STEPS}}
</Previous Steps>
<Available Input Variables>
{{INPUT_DATA}}
</Available Input Variables>

To write your step "prompt instruction" and your "requirements and conditions", pay attention to these instructions:
1. In <Step Prompt Instruction> tags, write the prompt instruction to execute and complete the provided step (<Step> tags). Always close the prompt instruction section with the </Step Prompt Instruction> tag.
2. Consider and use the variables in the <Available Input Variables> tags to write your template.
3. In <Requirements and Conditions> tags, identify and write all requirements and conditions closely related to the provided step (<Step> tags). Always close the requirements and conditions section with the </Requirements and Conditions> tag.
4. The <Requirements and Conditions> should include only requirements and conditions that are are closely related to the task in the <Step> tags and mentioned in the long complex task. The <Long Complex Task> must be the only scope for writing your <Requirements and Conditions> list.
5. Use, as much as you can, the same words and style as provided in the long complex task content (<Long Complex Task> tags).
6. Do not forget to always close each section with its corresponding close tag.
7. Don't forget to close the <Requirements and Conditions> tags at the end of your response.

Note: This is probably obvious to you already, but you are not *completing* the task here. You are writing instructions for an AI to complete the task.
Note: Another name for what you are writing is a "prompt template". When you put a variable name enclosed in double brackets into this template, it will later have the full value (which will be provided by a user or by the result from a previous step) substituted into it.
Note: When referencing the result of a previous step using its variable name on your instructions prompt template, you usually place the variable inside triple backquote characters (```). Example: \n```\n{{VARIABLE_NAME}}\n```\n
Note: When writing the requirements and conditions, do not reference and do not use the result of previous steps to write detected requirements. Don't use input variables inside the <Requirements and Conditions> tags.

It is extremely important to always close the <Requirements and Conditions> tags with "</Requirements and Conditions>" at the end of your answer.
