        Modified version of regular _create_grid. This version removes
        the requirement of the side borders being at least the size of the border radius.
        This gives the ability to have square, icon-only buttons with the icons centered nicely
        with less than the corner radius of spacing. The danger is: when spaced too close, the
        corners of the icon (even if transparent) may peek outside the button, which has to be manually
        avoided by settings sufficient border spacing now. By doing this manually, we can get closer
        to the danger-zone ;)
