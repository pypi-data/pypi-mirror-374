class VersionedModel(pydantic.BaseModel):
    """
    Extension of pydantic.BaseModel that includes functionality to easily define
    migrators to migrate the model from earlier versions of the format 
    while validating. This is useful in combination with ```el.datastore.specialized_file```
    to automatically migrate old file formats to new ones upon opening.

    To use this, inherit your model from ```VersionedBaseModel``` instead of ```pydantic.BaseModel```.
    This adds a "format_version" field. In each version of the model, change the default value
    of that field to identify the version:

    ```python
    class MyModelV1(VersionedBaseModel):
        format_version: int = 1
        username: str
        age: int

    class MyModelV2(VersionedBaseModel):
        format_version: int = 2
        name: str
        oldness: int
    
    class MyModelV3(pydantic.BaseModel):
        format_version: int = 3
        first_name: str
        years_alive: int
    ```

    Now to connect the model versions together, add a migrator to each model that migrates
    from the previous version to it's own:


    ```python
    class MyModelV1(VersionedBaseModel):
        format_version: int = 1
        username: str
        age: int

    class MyModelV2(VersionedBaseModel):
        format_version: int = 2
        name: str
        oldness: int

        @typing.override
        @classmethod
        def migrate(cls, old: MyModelV1) -> typing.Self:
            return MyModelV2(
                name=old.username,
                oldness=old.age,
            )
    
    class MyModelV3(pydantic.BaseModel):
        format_version: int = 3
        first_name: str
        years_alive: int

        @typing.override
        @classmethod
        def migrate(cls, old: MyModelV2) -> typing.Self:
            return MyModelV3(
                first_name=old.name,
                years_alive=old.oldness,
            )
    ```

    The migrator method MUST take an argument called "old" that is annotated with the previous
    version type, as that annotation is how ```VersionedBaseModel``` identifies the migration chain.

    Now, you can use MyModelV3 in your code, however whenever it is called with 
    data indicating a previous version, the chain of migrators is called to automatically migrate
    to the desired newer version:

    ```python
    m = MyModelV3(format_version=1, username="Bob", age=20)
    assert m.format_version == 3
    assert m.first_name == "Bob"
    assert m.years_alive == 20
    ```

    The first version obviously does not need a migrator specified. It marks the start of the version
    chain. If any model in the middle of the chain is missing a migrator this breaks the chain of migration.
    Version numbers don't need to be sequential, as the order of versions is identified by their links.
    It is however advised to number the versions in order.
