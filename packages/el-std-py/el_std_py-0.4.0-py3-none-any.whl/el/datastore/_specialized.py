# arguments.
# For some reason (probably weirdness with the pydantic pylance integration) we need

    Creates a datastore file object (with the specific type) from a datastore path.
    This path may be interpreted as a file path to determine the
    storage location of the operating system file containing the
    datastore "file" data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    All noted defaults assume they are not overridden using
    the specialized_file decorator. When parameters are specified
    in the decorator, those will be the default values.

    path : DSPath
        The location or identification to store the file data under.
        This consists of one or more string values that define a hierarchical location
        for sorting like a file system path, although it is not guaranteed for these to
        determine the actual file system path that the file is stored in. Also, the typical
        limitations associated with filesystem paths such as no slashes do not exist here.
        Any string can be used and the implementation will make sure to encode it an a valid way.
        The base_path from the specialized_file is prefixed to this.
    extension : str, optional
        The file extension to use for the actual file saved on a storage backend
        if applicable on that backend. By default "json".
    autosave : bool, optional
        Whether to initially enable autosave, by default True. Autosave can be disabled/enabled
        later on using set_autosave().
    autosave_interval : float, optional
        Interval between autosaves in seconds. By default 5.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Datastore path is empty.
    RuntimeError
        Datastore path points to an existing directory on the storage backend 
        which can and should not be replaced by a file automatically.

    A class decorator to create "specialized" datastore file classes directly from pydantic
    data models.

    Parameters
    ----------
    All Parameters are optional. When decorating without calling,
    the defaults are used. When providing them, most parameters
    (except base_path) serve as default values for the specialized 
    file class that is emitted.

    base_path : DSPath, optional
        A path prefix prepended to the path passed when instantiating
        the resulting specialized file. This can be used to group all files of a type
        in a certain folder. For single-use files this can also specify the full path, 
        so no path has to be passed at all when instantiating the file.
    extension : str, optional
        The default file extension to use for the actual file saved on a storage backend
        if applicable on that backend. By default "json".
    autosave : bool, optional
        Whether to initially enable autosave, by default True. Autosave can be disabled/enabled
        later on using set_autosave().
    autosave_interval : float | optional
        Default interval between autosaves in seconds. By default 5.

    Returns
    -------
    typing.Union[ type[SpecializedFile[OT]], typing.Callable[[type[IT]], type[SpecializedFile[IT]]] ]
        _description_

    Usage
    -------

    ```python
    @specialized_file
    class UserDataFile(pydantic.BaseModel):
        user_name: str = ""
        join_data: int = 0
        followers: int = 0
    ```

    SpecializedFile classes behave like the decorated model class, except they take the file 
    path as the initialization parameter. Type-Checkers will even believe that it is
    just the regular model after instantiation so all intellisense features will still work!
    
    So you can simply instantiate the above defined model and pass it the file path to store it. 
    After that you can use it like the regular data model but it will automatically save the data to disk:

    ```python
    user_data = UserDataFile(["user123423"])
    user_data.followers = 5
    ```

    Additionally, the specialized file decorator allows specifying a base path. This path will be prepended
    in front of the regular path passed to the file during instantiation:

    ```python
    @specialized_file(base_path=["users"])
    class UserDataFileOrganized(pydantic.BaseModel):
        user_name: str = ""
        join_data: int = 0
        followers: int = 0
    ```

    This is useful because you may want to group all datastore files of the same type together
    so they are more organized. For example, you might want to store every UserDataFile in a folder
    named "users", naming the file by the user name:

    ```python
    user_data_org = UserDataFileOrganized(["user123423"])
    user_data_org.followers = 5

    # Equivalent to the following without base path:
    user_data = UserDataFile(["users", "user123423"])
    user_data.followers = 5
    ```

    The two above variations are functionally equivalent, but with the base
    path you don't need to remember to specify the same base path everywhere a user file
    is accessed, which reduces the risk of bugs.

    By default the files are saved with a .json extension. This can be changed using the
    "extension" parameter:

    ```python
    @specialized_file(base_path=["users"], extension="user")
    class UserDataFileOrganized(pydantic.BaseModel):
        user_name: str = ""
        join_data: int = 0
        followers: int = 0

    # This will create a file called "users/user123423.user"
    user_data_org = UserDataFileOrganized(["user123423"])
    ```
