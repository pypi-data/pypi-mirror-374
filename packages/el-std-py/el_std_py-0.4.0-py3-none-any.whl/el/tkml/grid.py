    ----------

    columnspan : int, optional
        How many columns to the right the widget should span. 
        By default 1 (the current column).
    rowspan : int, optional
        How many rows down the widget should span. By default only 1.

    row_increment : bool, optional
        If disabled, the row context will not be incremented at all. This is 
        useful (in combination with column_override) if you want to add a lot

    """
    Generates a grid layout for an entire container by calculating grid indices 
    of widgets from their locations in the provided arrays similar to CSS grid 
    template areas. 

    Example:
    ```python
    a = tkl(...)
    b = tkl(...)
    c = tkl(...)
    d = tkl(...)
    grid_layout(
        (a, a, b, c),

    )
    ```

    Widgets can span multiple rows and/or columns which will result in their rowspan
    or columnspan being set. The span areas must be rectangular.

    If additional grid parameters need to be specified for specific widgets, they
    can be added using the `grid()` method directly (either before
    or after the `grid_layout()` call, doesn't matter) without passing row/column
    information to it. 
    
    This should not be mixed with calls to contextual TKML grid layout functions 
    such as `add_row()` etc. This layout method does not require any context and 
    could thus be used in a non-TKML environment as well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *rows : tuple[tk.Widget | None, ...]
        Lists representing the rows of a grid.
        `None` represents an empty cell.

    Raises
