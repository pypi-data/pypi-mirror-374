        Method that is called when a stateful filter instance
        is connected to an observable chain. The filter
        is given a weak reference to both the source observable 
        (the one whose change triggers a `__call__` on the filter)

        assigned if `__call__` returns a value), so it can autonomously
        and asynchronously trigger value updates in the chain without
        requiring an update from the source observable. This is useful
        for time-based filters (delay, throttle, ...).

        The reference is weak to avoid potential reference circles between
        the source observable and the StatefulFilter instance.
        The source observable holds a strong reference to the StatefulFilter,
        but the same should not be true in the other direction.

        references or clean up resources if applicable. The source

        Adds a new observer function to the observable.
        This acts exactly the same as the ">>" operator and is intended

        would be confusing.

        If the observable already has a value, the observer is called immediately.

        This returns a new observer that observes the return value of observer function.
        This allows you to create derived observables with any conversion function
        between them or chain multiple conversions.

        When a function returns ... (Ellipsis), this is interpreted as "no value" and
        the derived observable is not updated. This can be used to create filter functions.

            >> operator). If the source observable has no value, an initial update
            will never be emitted.
