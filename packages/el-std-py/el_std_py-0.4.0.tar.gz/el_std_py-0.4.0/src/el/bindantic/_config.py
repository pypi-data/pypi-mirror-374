== Bindantic struct field configuration ==

Bindantic needs to have the ability to configure options for fields.
Some of the options have to work together with existing Pydantic features
while some are exclusive to Bindantic structs.

For this reason, there Bindantic defines config functions that return a 
config info object that can then be parsed during model creation (similar
to the pydantic.Field()).

Unlike Pydantic, Bindantic only supports configuration via annotation, not via
attribute assignment, although some options might still work with assignment
because they use Pydantic FieldInfo in the background which is parsed by Pydantic.

The Bindantic config functions only serve one purpose each, so you may have to combine
multiple functions to reach the desired configuration.
Some of these function which also have an effect on existing pydantic features return
pydantic.FieldInfo. Those are simply a shortcut for a common config required for binary
structs. 
Others return an instance of a subclass of bindantic.FieldConfigItem. These options
are specific to Bindantic and are parsed by Bindantic itself (Pydantic is still responsible
for metadata collection)

Internally during struct construction, all metadata is read through and all FieldConfigItems
and other elements that are pydantic compatible are read out and converted into FieldConfigItems
that are stored in the FieldConfigOptions instance of each field.

    This specifies how many elements the array must be able to hold. The structure
    will always contain enough space to hold this maximum amount of elements.

    By default, this also specifies the maximum size for pydantic, meaning that arrays
    greater than this size will cause a validation error. 
    
    If 'min' is set to a value other than 0, a minimum size for pydantic is defined causing pydantic to 
    raise a validation error for any sequences shorter than the full array/string size. If set to
    "same", 'val' will be used as the minimum, effectively enforcing the sequence to have the exact specified
    size.

    If the 'ignore' option is set to True,
    this behavior is disabled and pydantic will not enforce any length requirements when validating.
    In this case, the 'min' option has no effect.
