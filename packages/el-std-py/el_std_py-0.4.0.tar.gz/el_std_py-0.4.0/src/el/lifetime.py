            Value to identify the registration. The creation

    is called)
    
    This lifetime object can be used as a context manager by calling it
    to automatically register all observation made under the context to this lifetime.
    This works with any objects that inherit form and implement `AbstractRegistry`,
    e.g. Observables:

    ```python
    lt = LifetimeManager()
    obs = Observable(...)
    with lt():
        obs >> self._on_change
    ```
    
    The call operator is necessary to allow managing the context on a per-call basis in
    case multiple calls happen concurrently in different threads or asyncio tasks.

    It is to be noted that the lifetime does not hold hard references to any registries
    it manages. It therefore doesn't prevent registries form disablign
