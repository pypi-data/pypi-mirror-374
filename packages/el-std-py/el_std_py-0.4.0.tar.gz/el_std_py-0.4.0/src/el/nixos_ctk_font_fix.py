WARNING! Wild botch ahead!
Runtime changes the permissions of the Customtkinter
font files that CTk copies to ~/.fonts at every startup.
On NixOS these are copied from the store, and therefore have only
read permissions. On the next start, font loading fails because the fonts
couldn't be overwritten and CTk doesn't like that (even though it's not an issue).
So to fix this we just add write permissions to those files by importing
this module very early at application startup (before importing CTk).

This should probably fixed with a patch of customtkinter on nixpkgs but
is a dirty workaround for the time being.
