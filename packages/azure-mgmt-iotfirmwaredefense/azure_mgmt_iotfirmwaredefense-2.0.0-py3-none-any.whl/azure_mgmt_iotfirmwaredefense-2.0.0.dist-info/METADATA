# Microsoft Azure SDK for Python

This is the Microsoft Azure Iotfirmwaredefense Management Client Library.
This package has been tested with Python 3.9+.
For a more complete view of Azure libraries, see the [azure sdk python release](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/all).

## _Disclaimer_

_Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ is required to use this package.
- [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)

### Install the package

```bash
pip install azure-mgmt-iotfirmwaredefense
pip install azure-identity
```

### Authentication

By default, [Azure Active Directory](https://aka.ms/awps/aad) token authentication depends on correct configuration of the following environment variables.

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` for Azure client ID.
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` for Azure tenant ID.
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` for Azure client secret.

In addition, Azure subscription ID can be configured via environment variable `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.

With above configuration, client can be authenticated by following code:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.mgmt.iotfirmwaredefense import IoTFirmwareDefenseMgmtClient
import os

sub_id = os.getenv("AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID")
client = IoTFirmwareDefenseMgmtClient(credential=DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id=sub_id)
```

## Examples

Code samples for this package can be found at:
- [Search Iotfirmwaredefense Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=python&term=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing&terms=Getting%20started%20-%20Managing) on docs.microsoft.com
- [Azure Python Mgmt SDK Samples Repo](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt/samples)
