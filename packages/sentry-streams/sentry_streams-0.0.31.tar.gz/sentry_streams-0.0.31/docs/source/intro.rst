Sentry Streams is a distributed platform that, like most streaming platforms,
is designed to handle real-time unbounded data streams.

This is built primarily to allow the creation of Sentry ingestion pipelines
though the api provided is fully independent from the Sentry product and can
be used to build any streaming application.

The main features are:

* Kafka sources and multiple sinks. Ingestion pipeline take data from Kafka
  and write enriched data into multiple data stores.

* Dataflow API support. This allows the creation of streaming application
  focusing on the application logic and pipeline topology rather than
  the underlying dataflow engine.

* Support for stateful and stateless transformations. The state storage is
  provided by the platform rather than being part of the application.

* Distributed execution. The primitives used to build the application can
  be distributed on multiple nodes by configuration.

* Hide the Kafka details from the application. Like commit policy and topic
  partitioning.

* Out of the box support for some streaming applications best practices:
  DLQ, monitoring, health checks, etc.

* Support for Rust and Python applications.

* Support for multiple runtimes.

Design principles
=================

This streaming platform, in the context of Sentry ingestion, is designed
with a few principles in mind:

* Fully self service to speed up the time to reach production when building pipelines.
* Abstract infrastructure aspect away (Kafka, delivery guarantees, schemas, scale, etc.) to improve stability and scale.
* Opinionated in the abstractions provided to build ingestion to push for best practices and to hide the inner working of streaming applications.
* Pipeline as a system for tuning, capacity management and architecture understanding

Getting Started
=================

In order to build a streaming application and run it on top of the Sentry Arroyo
runtime, follow these steps:

1. Run locally a Kafka broker.

2. Create a new Python project and a dev environment.

3. Import sentry streams

.. code-block::

    pip install sentry_streams

For local development, instead of using pip, install the package from the source code:

.. code-block::

    make install-dev


4. Create a new Python module for your streaming application, or use one of the examples from the `sentry_streams/examples` folder:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from sentry_kafka_schemas.schema_types.ingest_metrics_v1 import IngestMetric
    from sentry_streams.pipeline.pipeline import Parser, Serializer
    from sentry_streams.pipeline import streaming_source

    pipeline = (
        streaming_source(
            name="myinput",
            stream_name="ingest-metrics",
        )
        .apply(Parser[IngestMetric]("parse_msg"))
        .apply(Serializer("serializer"))
        .sink(
            StreamSink(name="mysink", stream_name="transformed-events"),
        )
    )

This is a simple pipeline that takes a stream of JSON messages that fits the schema of the "ingest-metrics" topic (from sentry-kafka-schema), parses them,
casts them to the message type IngestMetric object, and serializes them back to JSON and produces the result to another topic.

Note that if these topics don't exist, they will need to be created. With docker:

.. code-block::

    docker exec -it <YOUR KAFKA CONTAINER NAME> kafka-topics --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --create --topic ingest-metrics --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
    docker exec -it <YOUR KAFKA CONTAINER NAME> kafka-topics --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --create --topic transformed-events --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1


5. Run the pipeline

.. code-block::

    SEGMENT_ID=0 python -m sentry_streams.runner \
    -n Batch \
    --config sentry_streams/deployment_config/<YOUR CONFIG FILE>.yaml \
    --adapter rust-arroyo \
    --segment-id 0 \
    <YOUR PIPELINE FILE>

for the above code example, use `sentry_streams/sentry_streams/deployment_config/simple_map_filter.yaml` for the deployment config file (assuming you have two local Kafka topics for source and sink)

6. Produce events on the `ingest-metrics` topic and consume them from the `transformed-events` topic.

.. code-block::

    echo '{"org_id": 420, "project_id": 420, "name": "c:sessions/session@none", "tags": {}, "timestamp": 1111111111111111, "retention_days": 90, "type": "c", "value": 1}' | kcat -b localhost:9092 -P -t ingest-metrics

.. code-block::

    kcat -b localhost:9092 -G test transformed-events


7. Look for more examples in the `sentry_streams/examples` folder of the repository.
