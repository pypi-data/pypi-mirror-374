# The Sentry Streaming Platform

Sentry Streams is a distributed platform that, like most streaming platforms,
is designed to handle real-time unbounded data streams.

This is built primarily to allow the creation of Sentry ingestion pipelines
though the api provided is fully independent from the Sentry product and can
be used to build any streaming application.
