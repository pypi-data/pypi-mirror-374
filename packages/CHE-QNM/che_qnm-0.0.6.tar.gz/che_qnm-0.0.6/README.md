# CHE_QNM
Using Confluent Heun Functions to solve for QNMs. Focussing on AS and unconventional modes with the intent of learning about the vector space properties.

For basic explanation of the code, some of the findings using this code, an overview of the planned updates of this package and a list of literature sources, look at the documentation CHE_QNM file at the github https://github.com/StefHusken/CHE_QNM..

The method is based on arxiv.org/abs/2506.14635v3. Furthermore we use https://github.com/motygin/confluent_Heun_functions to evaluate confluent heun functions in matlab.
To compare with the paper above we use the repository: https://github.com/IronChen1/Complete-QNMs. The python code also uses the positive package https://github.com/llondon6/positive. Note that the python code is not to be distributed because it is a literal translation of Motygin's code.
