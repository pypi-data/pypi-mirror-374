## Installation

| Installation Method | Command |

| Via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) | `pip install dbrownell_Placeholder` |

### Verifying Signed Artifacts
Artifacts are signed and verified using [py-minisign](https://github.com/x13a/py-minisign) and the public key in the file `./minisign_key.pub`.

To verify that an artifact is valid, visit [the latest release](https://github.com/davidbrownell/dbrownell_Placeholder/releases/latest) and download the `.minisign` signature file that corresponds to the artifact, then run the following command, replacing `<filename>` with the name of the artifact to be verified:

```shell
uv run --with py-minisign python -c "import minisign; minisign.PublicKey.from_file('minisign_key.pub').verify_file('<filename>'); print('The file has been verified.')"
```
