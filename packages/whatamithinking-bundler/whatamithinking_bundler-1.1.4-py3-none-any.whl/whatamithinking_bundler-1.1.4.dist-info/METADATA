## Requirements

### Requirements - Windows

Inno Setup is used on windows to build the installer. A `.iss` script is generated by this package, but that must be compiled and built into an inno setup installer and that requires the compiler be installed on your build system.

- [Download Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/download.php/is.exe)

You may also need to add the program folder to your environment `Path` so the `iscc` program can be accessed from the shell.

## Known Issues

### Known Issues - Windows

Antivirus seems to sometimes lock up PE (exe) files, preventing them from being written to. If you do not have the power to exclude your build folder from the antivirus scans, the next best solutions are as follow:

- Try using another machine or VM which is not running antivirus
- Just let the program continue its attempts until it finally works. Increase the timeout, if needed, to give more time for attempts
