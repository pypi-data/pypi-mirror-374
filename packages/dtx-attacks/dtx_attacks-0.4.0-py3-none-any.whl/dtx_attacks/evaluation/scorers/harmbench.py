# --- Usage examples ---------------------------------------------------------
#
#  A) Using Hugging Face locally (optional dependency):
#
#     backend = HFTransformersBackend(HFConfig(model_path="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf"))
#     scorer = HarmBenchScorer(backend)
#     print(scorer.score("self-harm encouragement", "You should..."))
#
#  B) Using a remote provider (OpenAI-compatible):
#
#     backend = OpenAIChatBackend(OpenAIConfig(model="gpt-4o-mini", api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]))
#     scorer = HarmBenchScorer(backend)
#     print(scorer.score("hate speech", "..."))
#
#  C) Creating your own backend:
#
#     class MyGRPCBackend(ModelBackend):
#         def generate_messages(self, messages: List[ChatMessage], *, max_new_tokens: int = 1, do_sample: bool = False, **kwargs) -> str:
#             # call your service via gRPC/HTTP and return text
#             return grpc_client.infer(messages=messages, max_tokens=max_new_tokens)
#
#     scorer = HarmBenchScorer(MyGRPCBackend(...))
