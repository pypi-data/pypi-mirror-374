**Professional library for generating high-quality voiceovers in Manim animations using the Kokoro-82M model.**

Transform your Manim animations with natural-sounding, synchronized voiceovers. Unlike other tools that are often paid or produce unnatural voice quality, Kokoro Manim Voiceover leverages the powerful **Kokoro-82M parameter model** to deliver high-quality, free, and lifelike voiceovers.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

**Using pip:**
```bash
pip install kokoro-manim-voiceover
```

**Using uv:**
```bash
uv add kokoro-manim-voiceover
```

**From source (development):**

cd kokoro-manim-voiceover
pip install -e .
```

### First Use

When you first use the library, you'll be prompted to download the model files (~220MB total). This is a one-time setup:

```python
from manim import *
from manim_voiceover import VoiceoverScene
from kokoro_mv import KokoroService

class MyAnimation(VoiceoverScene):
    def construct(self):
        # Model files will be downloaded automatically on first use
        self.set_speech_service(KokoroService(voice="af"))
        
        with self.voiceover(text="Hello, this is my first voiceover!") as tracker:
            self.play(Write(Text("Hello World!")), run_time=tracker.duration)
```

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Basic Animation with Voiceover

```python
from manim import *
from manim_voiceover import VoiceoverScene
from kokoro_mv import KokoroService

class BasicExample(VoiceoverScene):
    def construct(self):
        self.set_speech_service(KokoroService(voice="af"))
        
        circle = Circle()
        square = Square().shift(2 * RIGHT)
        
        with self.voiceover(text="This circle is drawn as I speak.") as tracker:
            self.play(Create(circle), run_time=tracker.duration)
        
        with self.voiceover(text="Now let's transform it into a square.") as tracker:
            self.play(Transform(circle, square), run_time=tracker.duration)
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from kokoro_mv import KokoroService

# Custom configuration
service = KokoroService(
    voice="am_michael",  # Male voice
    speed=1.2,           # 20% faster
    lang="en-us"         # Language setting
)
```

### Multiple Voiceovers

```python
class MultiVoiceExample(VoiceoverScene):
    def construct(self):
        # Different voices for different speakers
        narrator = KokoroService(voice="af")
        character = KokoroService(voice="am_adam")
        
        self.set_speech_service(narrator)
        
        with self.voiceover(text="The narrator speaks first.") as tracker:
            self.play(Write(Text("Narrator")))
        
        # Switch to character voice
        self.set_speech_service(character)
        
        with self.voiceover(text="Then the character responds.") as tracker:
            self.play(Write(Text("Character")))
```

## üîß Model Files

The library automatically downloads the required model files on first use:

- **kokoro-v0_19.onnx** (~169MB) - Main TTS model
- **voices.bin** (~50MB) - Voice data

**Total download size**: ~220MB (one-time setup)

Files are cached locally and reused for future projects.

## üìö API Reference

### KokoroService

```python
KokoroService(
    engine=None,           # Custom engine (optional)
    model_path="",         # Custom model path (optional)
    voices_path="",        # Custom voices path (optional)
    voice="af",            # Voice selection
    speed=1.0,             # Speech speed multiplier
    lang="en-us",          # Language code
    **kwargs               # Additional arguments
)
```

### Methods

## üéØ Running Examples

To run the included example:

```bash
# After installation
manim main.py KokoExample
```

Or create your own animation file and import the service:

```python
from kokoro_mv import KokoroService
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Model Download Issues

If model files fail to download automatically:

```bash
# Run the setup command manually
kokoro-mv-setup
```

### Common Issues

1. **Python Version**: Ensure you're using Python 3.11+
2. **Dependencies**: All dependencies are installed automatically
3. **Model Files**: ~220MB download required on first use
4. **Permissions**: Ensure write permissions in your project directory
