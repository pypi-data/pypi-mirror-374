A terminal for JupyterLite.

⚠️ This extension is still in development and not yet ready for general use. ⚠️

## Requirements

- JupyterLite >= 0.6.0

## Install

To install the extension, execute:

```bash
pip install jupyterlite-terminal
```

You will also need to install the JupyterLite CLI:

```bash
python -m pip install jupyterlite-core
```

## Usage

After installing `jupyterlite-core` and `jupyterlite-terminal`, create a `jupyter-lite.json` file with the following content to activate the terminal extension:

```json
{
  "jupyter-lite-schema-version": 0,
  "jupyter-config-data": {
    "terminalsAvailable": true
  }
}
```

Then build a new JupyterLite site:

```bash
jupyter lite build
```

## Version compatibility

Each `jupyterlite-terminal` release is built against a specific version of `cockle`. If you need to
include imports from both `jupyterlite-terminal` and `cockle`, such as if you are implementing
`cockle` external commands, you should ensure that you are using the correct version combination.

| `jupyterlite-terminal` | `cockle` | `jupyterlite-core` |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.0                  | 1.0.0    | >= 0.6, < 0.7      |
| 0.2.2                  | 0.1.3    | >= 0.6, < 0.7      |

## Contributing

### Development install

Note: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.

The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.

```bash
# Clone the repo to your local environment
# Change directory to the jupyterlite_terminal directory
# Install package in development mode
pip install -e "."
# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes
jlpm build
```

You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.

```bash
# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed
jlpm watch
# Run JupyterLab in another terminal
jupyter lab
```

Then build a JupyterLite distribution with the extension installed:

```bash
cd deploy
jupyter lite build --contents contents
```

And serve it either using:

```bash
npx static-handler _output/
```

or:

```bash
jupyter lite serve
```

To enable use of SharedArrayBuffer rather than ServiceWorker for `stdin` you will have to configure your server to add the `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` and `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` headers. Do this using either:

```bash
npx static-handler --cors --coop --coep --corp _output/
```

or:

```bash
jupyter lite serve --LiteBuildConfig.extra_http_headers=Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy=require-corp --LiteBuildConfig.extra_http_headers=Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy=same-origin
```

### Packaging the extension

See [RELEASE](RELEASE.md)
