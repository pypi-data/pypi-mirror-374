## NOTICE: Symbolic and Theoretical Origins

Cognize is a symbolic cognition engine designed for programmable epistemic drift tracking and rupture detection.

Its architecture is inspired in part by a 2025 epistemic control framework developed by Pulikanti Sashi Bharadwaj.

Core concepts — including recursive projection fields, misalignment memory, and symbolic rupture logic — were originally introduced in a research context exploring dynamic belief regulation and cognitive stability under volatility.
