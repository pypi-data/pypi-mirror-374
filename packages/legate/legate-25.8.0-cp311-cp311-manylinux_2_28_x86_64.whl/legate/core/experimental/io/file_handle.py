        The file is opened in the constructor immediately and not in a
        Legate task. This means that re-opening a file that was created
        by a not-yet-executed Legate task requires a blocking fence like
        ``get_legate_runtime().issue_execution_fence(block=True)``.

        Additional limitations:
          - The file path to the file must not change while opened.
          - The file size can only be changed through this handle. That is,
            access to the file outside of this file handle is allowed as long
            as the file size doesn't change.
          - Writing to the file using a file handle (e.g. ``FileHandle.write``)
            is a deferred task thus in order to read the file at a later point,
            a blocking execution fence is required even when using the same
            file handle.
