   * @brief Gives the runtime a hint that the store can benefit from bloated instances.
   *
   * The runtime currently does not look ahead in the task stream to recognize that a given set of
   * tasks can benefit from the ahead-of-time creation of "bloated" instances encompassing multiple
   * slices of a store. This means that the runtime will construct bloated instances incrementally
   * and completely only when it sees all the slices, resulting in intermediate instances that
   * (temporarily) increases the memory footprint. This function can be used to give the runtime a
   * hint ahead of time about the bloated instances, which would be reused by the downstream tasks
   * without going through the same incremental process.
   *
   * For example, let's say we have a 1-D store A of size 10 and we want to partition A across two
   * GPUs. By default, A would be partitioned equally and each GPU gets an instance of size 5.
   * Suppose we now have a task that aligns two slices A[1:10] and A[:9]. The runtime would
   * partition the slices such that the task running on the first GPU gets A[1:6] and A[:5], and the
   * task running on the second GPU gets A[6:] and A[5:9]. Since the original instance on the first
   * GPU does not cover the element A[5] included in the first slice A[1:6], the mapper needs to
   * create a new instance for A[:6] that encompasses both of the slices, leading to an extra copy.
   * In this case, if the code calls `prefetch(A, {0}, {1})` to pre-alloate instances that contain
   * one extra element on the right before it uses A, the extra copy can be avoided.
   *
   * A couple of notes about the API:
   *
   * - Unless `initialize` is `true`, the runtime assumes that the store has been initialized.
   *   Passing an uninitialized store would lead to a runtime error.
   * - If the store has pre-existing instances, the runtime may combine those with the bloated
   *   instances if such combination is deemed desirable.
   *
   * @param store Store to create bloated instances for
   * @param low_offsets Offsets to bloat towards the negative direction
   * @param high_offsets Offsets to bloat towards the positive direction
   * @param initialize If `true`, the runtime will issue a fill on the store to initialize it. The
   * default value is `false`
   *
   * @note This API is experimental

  /**
   * @brief Issues a mapping fence
   *
   * A mapping fence, when issued, blocks mapping of all downstream operations before those
   * preceding the fence get mapped. An `issue_mapping_fence` call returns immediately after the
   * request is submitted to the runtime, and the fence asynchronously goes through the runtime
   * analysis pipeline just like any other Legate operations. The call also flushes the scheduling
   * window for batched execution.
   *
   * Mapping fences only affect how the operations are mapped and do not change their execution
   * order, so they are semantically no-op. Nevertheless, they are sometimes useful when the user
   * wants to control how the resource is consumed by independent tasks. Consider a program with two
   * independent tasks A and B, both of which discard their stores right after their execution.  If
   * the stores are too big to be allocated all at once, mapping A and B in parallel (which can
   * happen because A and B are independent and thus nothing stops them from getting mapped
   * concurrently) can lead to a failure. If a mapping fence exists between the two, the runtime
   * serializes their mapping and can reclaim the memory space from stores that would be discarded
   * after A's execution to create allocations for B.
