// This forward declaration is technically not sufficient. get_physical_array() returns a

// std::optional<LogicalStore> member, so we have a declaration cycle.
//
// But, it seems like any code that uses a LogicalStore ends up transitively including the
// physical_store.h header, and so this incorrect forward decl doesn't come to bite us (yet).
//
// Instead of having PhysicalStore hold a std::optional<LogicalStore>, we could have it hold a
// std::optional<SharedPtr<LogicalStoreImpl>> (assuming we pull LogicalStore::Impl out and
// rename it).
//
// But this is undesirable because it break encapsulation by leaking the implementation detail
// of LogicalStore to its physical counterpart. We also would have to do this for any child
// objects of LogicalStore, including when it undergoes transformation.

// So the least bad option is to do this fwd decl...

/**
 * @brief A multi-dimensional data container
 *
 * `LogicalStore` is a multi-dimensional data container for fixed-size elements. Stores are
 * internally partitioned and distributed across the system. By default, Legate clients need
 * not create nor maintain the partitions explicitly, and the Legate runtime is responsible
 * for managing them. Legate clients can control how stores should be partitioned for a given
 * task by attaching partitioning constraints to the task (see the constraint module for
 * partitioning constraint APIs).
 *
 * Each `LogicalStore` object is a logical handle to the data and is not immediately associated
 * with a physical allocation. To access the data, a client must "map" the store to a physical
 * store (`PhysicalStore`). A client can map a store by passing it to a task, in which case the
 * task body can see the allocation, or calling `LogicalStore::get_physical_store()`, which
 * gives the client a handle to the physical allocation (see `PhysicalStore` for details about
 * physical stores).
 *
 * Normally, a `LogicalStore` gets a fixed `Shape` upon creation. However, there is a special
 * type of logical stores called "unbound" stores whose shapes are unknown at creation
 * time. (see `Runtime` for the logical store creation API.) The shape of an unbound store is
 * determined by a task that first updates the store; upon the submission of the task, the
 * `LogicalStore` becomes a normal store. Passing an unbound store as a read-only argument or
 * requesting a `PhysicalStore` of an unbound store are invalid.
 *
 * One consequence due to the nature of unbound stores is that querying the shape of a previously
 * unbound store can block the client's control flow for an obvious reason; to know the shape of
 * the `LogicalStore` whose `Shape` was unknown at creation time, the client must wait until the
 * updater task to finish. However, passing a previously unbound store to a downstream operation can
 * be non-blocking, as long as the operation requires no changes in the partitioning and mapping for
 * the `LogicalStore`.
