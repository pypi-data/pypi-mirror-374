/**
 * @brief A class to express shapes of multi-dimensional entities in Legate
 *
 * `Shape` objects describe *logical* shapes, of multi-dimensional containers in Legate such as
 * Legate arrays and Legate stores. For example, if the shape of a Legate store is `(4, 2)`,
 * the store is conceptually a 2D container having four rows and two columns of elements.  The
 * shape however does not entail any particular physical manifestation of the container. The
 * aforementioned 2D store can be mapped to an allocation in which the elements of each row
 * would be contiguously located or an allocation in which the elements of each column would
 * be contiguously located.
 *
 * A `Shape` object is essentially a tuple of extents, one for each dimension, and the
 * dimensionality, i.e., the number of dimensions, is the size of this tuple. The volume of the
 * `Shape` is a product of all the extents.
 *
 * Since Legate allows containers' shapes to be determined by tasks, some shapes may not be "ready"
 * when the control code tries to introspect their extents. In this case, the control code will be
 * blocked until the tasks updating the containers are complete. This asynchrony behind the shape
 * objects is hidden from the control code and it's recommended that introspection of the shapes of
 * unbound arrays or stores should be avoided. The blocking behavior of each API call can be found
 * in its reference (methods with no mention of blocking should exhibit no shape-related blocking).
