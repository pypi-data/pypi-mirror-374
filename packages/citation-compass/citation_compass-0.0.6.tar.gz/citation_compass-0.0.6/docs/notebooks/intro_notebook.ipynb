    "\n",
    "CitationCompass is a lightweight package for annotating and extracting citable portions of scientific code from Python modules. It is meant for authors of a codebase to make discovery of citable blocks of code easier (as opposed to being designed to analyze un-annotated code).  In this tutorial we examine the different ways authors can inject citation information."

CitationCompass provides two mechanisms: retrieving everything that has been annotated (`get_all_citations()`) and retrieving annotated items that have been used (`get_used_citations()`). Both of these functions return a list of strings.\n",
