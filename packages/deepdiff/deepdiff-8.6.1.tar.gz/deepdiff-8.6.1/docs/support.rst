Support
=======

üëã Hi there,

Thank you for using DeepDiff!
If you find a bug, please create a ticket on our `GitHub repo <https://github.com/seperman/deepdiff>`__

I am **available for consulting** if you need immediate help or custom implementations of DeepDiff. You can reach me by emailing hello at this domain.

I love working on DeepDiff and other open-source projects. These projects will stay free and open source forever. If my work has been helpful to you, I would appreciate any sponsorship. 

Please `click here <https://github.com/sponsors/seperman>`__ for sponsorship information.

| Lastly, you might be interested in another tool I've crafted: ‚ö° `Qluster <https://qluster.ai/solution>`__.
| As an engineer, I understand the frustration of wrestling with **unruly data** in pipelines.
| I developed Qluster to empower product managers and ops teams to control and resolve data issues autonomously and **stop bugging the engineers**! üõ†Ô∏è
|
| If you are going through this pain now, I would love to give you `early access <https://www.qluster.ai/try-qluster>`__ to Qluster and get your feedback.
