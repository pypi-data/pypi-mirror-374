# Advanced Templates with Conditional Rendering & Complex Variables

This example demonstrates **advanced Handlebars template features** including conditional rendering, loops, nested templates, and complex variable structures. It showcases the full power of the template system for dynamic prompt generation.

## üöÄ **Quick Start - Try It Now!**

```bash
llm-ci-runner \
  --template-file examples/05-templates/advanced-templates/template.hbs \
  --template-vars examples/05-templates/advanced-templates/template-vars.yaml \
  --schema-file examples/05-templates/advanced-templates/schema.yaml \
  --output-file advanced-analysis.yaml
```

## üåü **Features Demonstrated**

- **‚úÖ Conditional Rendering**: `{{#if}}` and `{{#unless}}` blocks for dynamic content
- **‚úÖ Complex Loops**: `{{#each}}` with nested conditions and formatting
- **‚úÖ Nested Objects**: Deep object traversal and property access
- **‚úÖ Template Composition**: Modular template structure with reusable components
- **‚úÖ Advanced Variables**: Complex YAML structures with arrays, objects, and mixed types
- **‚úÖ Dynamic Content**: Context-aware template rendering based on project type

## üìÅ **Files**

- **`template.hbs`** - Advanced Handlebars template with conditional rendering and loops
- **`template-vars.yaml`** - Complex YAML variables demonstrating nested structures
- **`schema.yaml`** - Comprehensive YAML schema for structured analysis output
- **`README.md`** - This comprehensive documentation

## üîÑ **How It Works**

### **1. Advanced Template Features**

The template demonstrates sophisticated Handlebars capabilities:

```handlebars
{{#if expertise.certifications}}
**Certifications:** {{#each expertise.certifications}}{{this}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}
{{/if}}

{{#each project.requirements}}
{{#if this.priority}}
**{{this.priority}} Priority:** {{this.description}}
{{else}}
- {{this.description}}
{{/if}}
{{/each}}
```

### **2. Complex Variable Structures**

Uses nested YAML objects with arrays, conditionals, and mixed data types:

```yaml
expertise:
  role: "Senior Software Architect"
  certifications: ["AWS Solutions Architect Professional", "Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect"]
  focus_areas: ["Scalability and performance optimization", "Security best practices"]

project:
  requirements:
    - priority: "High"
      description: "Migrate from monolithic to microservices architecture"
    - description: "Improve mobile app performance by 50%"
```

### **3. Dynamic Content Generation**

Template adapts content based on available variables:

- **Conditional sections** appear only when data is present
- **Loops with formatting** handle arrays with proper comma separation
- **Nested conditionals** provide context-aware rendering
- **Complex object traversal** accesses deeply nested properties

## üöÄ **Usage**

### **Primary Command**

```bash
llm-ci-runner \
  --template-file examples/05-templates/advanced-templates/template.hbs \
  --template-vars examples/05-templates/advanced-templates/template-vars.yaml \
  --schema-file examples/05-templates/advanced-templates/schema.yaml \
  --output-file advanced-analysis.yaml
```

### **Alternative: JSON Output**

```bash
llm-ci-runner \
  --template-file examples/05-templates/advanced-templates/template.hbs \
  --template-vars examples/05-templates/advanced-templates/template-vars.yaml \
  --schema-file examples/05-templates/advanced-templates/schema.yaml \

- Templates adapt to available data
- Conditional sections appear only when relevant
- Complex variable structures enable rich context

### **üîß Reusable Components**
- Modular template design
- Consistent formatting across different use cases
- Easy maintenance and updates

### **üìä Comprehensive Analysis**
- Structured output with detailed assessments
- Actionable recommendations with effort estimates
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### **üîÑ Flexible Configuration**
- YAML variables for easy customization
- Support for complex nested structures
- Conditional rendering based on project type

## üöÄ **Use Cases**

- **Enterprise Architecture Reviews**: Comprehensive system analysis
- **Security Audits**: Detailed vulnerability assessment
