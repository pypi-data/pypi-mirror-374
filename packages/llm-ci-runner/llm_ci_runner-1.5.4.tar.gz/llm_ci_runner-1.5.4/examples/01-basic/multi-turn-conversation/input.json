            "content": "Great! Let me help you design a scalable authentication system. Before I provide a detailed architecture, I need to understand a few key requirements:\n\n1. **Identity Providers**: Which specific providers do you need to support? (OAuth2, SAML, LDAP, custom, etc.)\n2. **Session Management**: Do you need session-based auth or stateless JWT tokens?\n3. **Data Storage**: Any preferences for user data storage? (SQL, NoSQL, external provider)\n4. **Security Requirements**: Any specific compliance needs? (SOC2, GDPR, etc.)\n5. **Deployment Environment**: Cloud platform preferences? (AWS, Azure, GCP, on-premise)\n\nThis will help me tailor the architecture to your specific needs."

Based on your requirements, here's a comprehensive authentication system design:\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n**Core Components:**\n- **API Gateway** (AWS API Gateway) - Route auth requests\n- **Auth Service** (Node.js/Python) - Handle authentication logic\n- **User Service** (Node.js/Python) - Manage user data\n- **Token Service** (Node.js/Python) - JWT generation/validation\n- **PostgreSQL** - User data storage\n- **Redis** - Session caching and rate limiting\n\n**Security Features:**\n- JWT tokens with configurable expiration\n- Rate limiting per IP/user\n- Input validation and sanitization\n- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)\n- HTTPS/TLS encryption\n\nWould you like me to dive deeper into any specific component or discuss the implementation details?"
