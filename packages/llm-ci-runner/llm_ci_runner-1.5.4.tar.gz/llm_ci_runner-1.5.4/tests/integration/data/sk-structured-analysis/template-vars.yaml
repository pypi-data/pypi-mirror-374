  The new CI/CD pipeline implementation has significantly improved our deployment frequency. 
  Teams are now able to deploy to production multiple times per day instead of weekly releases. 
  However, there are still some concerns about test coverage and monitoring capabilities. 
  The development team is enthusiastic about the changes, but operations teams have expressed 
  some reservations about the increased deployment velocity.
