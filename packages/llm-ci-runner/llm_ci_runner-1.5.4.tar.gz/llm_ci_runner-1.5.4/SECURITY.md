## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

### **Preferred Method: GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting**

We have enabled **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** for this repository. This is the **preferred and most secure method** to report security vulnerabilities.

**To report a vulnerability:**

1. **Navigate to the Security tab** on our GitHub repository
2. **Click "Report a vulnerability"** to open the advisory form
3. **Fill in the advisory details** with as much information as possible
4. **Submit the report** - GitHub will notify maintainers directly

**Benefits of this method:**
- ‚úÖ **Fully private** - No public disclosure risk
- ‚úÖ **Direct maintainer notification** - Immediate response
- ‚úÖ **Structured reporting** - GitHub's standardized form
- ‚úÖ **Collaboration tools** - Private discussion and fix coordination
- ‚úÖ **Automatic credit** - You'll be credited for the discovery

**Include in your message:**
- Vulnerability description
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your preferred disclosure timeline

## üîç What We Consider Security Vulnerabilities

### **Critical Security Issues**
- **Data exposure** - Sensitive information leakage
- **Code injection** - Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- **Privilege escalation** - Unauthorized privilege elevation
- **Cryptographic weaknesses** - Weak encryption or hashing

### **High Priority Issues**
- **Input validation flaws** - XSS, command injection
- **Authentication weaknesses** - Flawed authentication mechanisms
- **Information disclosure** - Debug information, error messages

### **Medium Priority Issues**
- **Configuration weaknesses** - Insecure default settings
- **Logging deficiencies** - Insufficient audit trails
- **Error handling** - Information disclosure through errors
- **Dependency vulnerabilities** - Known CVEs in dependencies

### **Low Priority Issues**
- **Cosmetic issues** - UI/UX security concerns
- **Documentation gaps** - Missing security documentation
- **Best practice violations** - Non-critical security improvements

## ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

### **Initial Response**
- **Critical/High**: Within 24 hours
- **Medium**: Within 72 hours
- **Low**: Within 1 week

### **Resolution Timeline**
- **Critical**: 7 days or immediate patch
- **High**: 14 days
- **Medium**: 30 days
- **Low**: 90 days or next release

### **Public Disclosure**
- **Coordinated disclosure** - We work with reporters on timing
- **Credit acknowledgment** - Proper attribution for security researchers
- **CVE assignment** - We'll request CVEs for significant issues

## üîß Security Measures

### **Dependency Security**
- **Established libraries**: Use established libraries throughout the codebase
- **Automated scanning**: `pip-audit` in CI/CD pipeline
- **Regular updates**: Monthly dependency reviews
- **Vulnerability monitoring**: Automated alerts for known CVEs

### **Code Security**
- **Static analysis**: Ruff linting with security rules
- **Type safety**: MyPy strict type checking
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive schema enforcement
- **Error handling**: Secure error messages

### **Infrastructure Security**
- **HTTPS only**: All communications encrypted
- **Environment variables**: No hardcoded secrets
- **Least privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive security event logging

## üß™ Security Testing

### **Automated Security Checks (part of pipeline)**
```bash
# Run security audit
uv run pip-audit

# Check for hardcoded secrets
grep -r "sk-" . --exclude=*.md --exclude=*.txt
```

### **Manual Security Testing**
- **Input validation testing** - Malicious input scenarios
- **Authentication testing** - Credential bypass attempts
- **Authorization testing** - Access control verification
- **Data protection testing** - Sensitive data handling
- **Dependency updates** - Regular dependency updates
