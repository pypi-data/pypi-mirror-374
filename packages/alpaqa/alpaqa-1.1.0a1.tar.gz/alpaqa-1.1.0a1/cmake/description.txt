alpaqa is an efficient implementation of an augmented Lagrangian method for general nonlinear programming problems, which uses the first-order, matrix-free PANOC algorithm as an inner solver.

The numerical algorithms themselves are implemented in C++ for optimal performance, and they are exposed as an easy-to-use Python package. An experimental MATLAB interface is available as well.
