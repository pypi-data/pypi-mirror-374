This package aims to provide a fluent interface for acquiring variant records
from the Leiden Open Variants Database (LOVD). Because it is so new, the `lovdtools`
package is by no means feature-complete, and its API is not stable enough for
production use. That said, if you do decide to experiment with any of its client
interfaces, feel free to provide feedback.

## Installation

The `lovdtools` package is available on PyPI, so you can simply install it with `pip`
(or your favorite drop-in):

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.
python -m venv lovdenv

# Activate the newly created virtual environment.
source ./lovdenv/bin/activate

# Upgrade `pip` to the latest version, as a best practice.
pip install --self-upgrade

# Install the package.
pip install lovdtools
```

After running the above commands, the `lovd` package should be available to
your Python interpreter. You can confirm this by running the following command:

```bash
python -c import lovd
```

If the above command does not yield any error output, then you have successfully
installed `lovdtools`.

## Contributing

I hope these tools will prove helpful to whomever needs to query LOVD. If you would
like to contribute, please fork the repository, make your changes, and then submit
a pull request, as you would with any other open-source contribution.
