# TODO LIST

- Add some kind of load balancing feature to get around AI provider rate limiting policy, by rotating different subscription services on a single endpoint for seamless experience. 
- Add tutorials on how to get free llm subscriptions though stuff like school education account and etc. 
- create config directory with all of the client application that can use this local api and write up a readme.md on how to use those files in different applications.
- fix the one response on for gemini and claude provider with crush cli. But works fine with Jan. 
- add some kind of Windows OS native runner instead of relying on WSL to get all of the providers to operate properly.
