Metabolic Analysis for Transdisciplinary Ecological Research

[TOC]

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher

We recommend using one virtual environment per Python project to manage dependencies and maintain isolation. You can use a package manager like [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to help you with library dependencies and virtual environments.

## üì¶ Install the Mater Package

Install the `mater` package via pip:

```bash
pip install mater
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Run a Simulation

The `mater` command line interface (CLI) makes it easy to run simulations. Ensure the required [Excel input file](https://zenodo.org/search?q=parent.id%3A12751420&f=allversions%3Atrue&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=version) (chose a compatible version) is located in the root of your working directory.

Run the following command to start a simulation from your excel file:

```bash
mater run -i <YOUR_INPUT_FILE_NAME>
```

## üìä Visualize Variables

Simulation results are stored locally in [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/) (.mater) files.

### User Interface

Results can be visualize in a built-in user interface. Go to the directory containing the result folder and use the following command :

```bash
mater plot -o <YOUR_RESULT_FOLDER_NAME>
```

### Accessing the Results from a Python Script

Below is an example Python script using `pandas` and `matplotlib` to plot specific simulation results. Each folder in the output directory corresponds to a variable that can be loaded with `pandas`.

```python
# Import the MATER package and matplotlib.pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mater import Mater

# Create a Mater instance
model = Mater()

# Select the output directory where the run results are stored
model.set_output_dir()  # Defaults to the working directory

# Set the run directory name
model.set_run_name("run0")

# Get a variable
in_use_stock = model.get("in_use_stock")

# Transform the dataframe and plot the results
in_use_stock.groupby(level=["location", "object"]).sum().T.plot()
plt.show()
```

This example demonstrates how to access and plot variables from simulation outputs. Adjust the code to fit your analysis needs.
