Reduced Representation Engine

Implements Plate (1995) Section V "Reduced Representations" (pages 631-633).
Addresses FIXME #1: Missing reduced representations encoding with cleanup memory
and systematic reduction from full compositional representation to compact form.

Research-Accurate Implementation of:
- Cleanup memory with threshold-based reduction
- Reduction factor for controlled compression  
- Reduced vocabulary of common compositional patterns
- Hierarchical reduction: complex → intermediate → reduced forms

Based on: Plate (1995) Section V, page 631; Figure 2, page 632
