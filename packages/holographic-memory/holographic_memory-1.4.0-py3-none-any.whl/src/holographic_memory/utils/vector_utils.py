üßÆ Vector Utility Functions for Holographic Memory Systems
=========================================================

üß† ELI5 Explanation:
Think of holographic memory like a magic photo album where each photo can store thousands 
of overlapping images. When you want to remember something, you shine a "search light" 
(query vector) on the photo, and all related memories light up at once. The vector 
utilities here are like the tools for creating these magic photos - they help make 
vectors (mathematical lists of numbers) that can store and retrieve memories by:

1. Creating random "memory slots" (vectors) that don't interfere with each other
2. Making sure all vectors have the right "brightness" (normalization) so they work together
3. Adding controlled "static" (noise) to test how robust the memories are
4. Measuring how "similar" different memories are to find the right one
5. Organizing vectors so they're independent (orthogonalization) like separate TV channels

Just like how a hologram can store multiple 3D images in one piece of film, these vectors 
can store multiple memories in one mathematical space. The key insight from Tony Plate's 
research is that you can bind concepts together using special math operations (like 
circular convolution) and later unbind them to get the original concepts back.

    memory = concept_A ‚äõ concept_B
    concept_A ‚âà memory ‚äõ concept_B‚Åª¬π  (where concept_B‚Åª¬π is approximate inverse)

    üìà Analyze Vector Space Properties for HRR Validation
    
    Computes comprehensive statistics to validate that a vector collection
    satisfies the mathematical requirements for stable holographic memory
    operations. Good HRR vectors should be approximately orthogonal, unit-
    normalized, and evenly distributed in the vector space.
    
    üß† HRR Quality Metrics:
    - **Low average similarity**: ‚ü®v·µ¢, v‚±º‚ü© ‚âà 0 indicates near-orthogonality
    - **Unit norms**: ||v·µ¢|| ‚âà 1 ensures stable circular convolution
    - **Even distribution**: Balanced mean/std prevents bias in retrieval
    - **Low sparsity**: Dense vectors utilize full representational capacity
    - **Controlled noise**: Statistics reveal vector space quality
    
    Research Validation Targets (from Plate 1995, Kanerva 2009):
    - Average pairwise similarity: < 0.1 (near-orthogonal)
    - Norm standard deviation: < 0.05 (consistent magnitudes)
    - Mean close to zero: prevents systematic bias
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    vectors : np.ndarray
        Collection of concept vectors (shape: n_vectors, vector_dim)
        Typically a vocabulary of concepts for holographic memory
        
    Returns
    -------
    Dict[str, Any]
        Comprehensive statistics including:
        - n_vectors, vector_dim: basic dimensions
        - mean_values: distribution of vector means
        - std_values: distribution of vector standard deviations  
        - range_values: min/max values across all elements
        - norms: distribution of vector magnitudes
        - similarities: pairwise similarity statistics
        - sparsity: fraction of near-zero elements
        - memory_usage_mb: storage requirements
        
    Usage:
    stats = vector_statistics(concept_vocabulary)
    if stats['similarities']['mean'] > 0.1:
        print("Warning: Vectors not sufficiently orthogonal for HRR")
    if stats['norms']['std'] > 0.1:
        print("Warning: Vector norms not consistent - renormalize")
