## Theoretical Foundations

### Holographic Reduced Representations Theory
Tony Plate's HRR provides a mathematical framework for compositional distributed representations:

#### Circular Correlation Operation
The fundamental binding operation uses circular correlation:
```
(a ⊛ b)ᵢ = Σⱼ aⱼ × b₍ᵢ₋ⱼ₎ mod n
```
Where ⊛ denotes circular correlation (binding) and vectors are of dimension n.

#### Key Mathematical Properties
- **Quasi-commutativity**: a ⊛ b ≈ b ⊛ a (similar but not identical)
- **Associativity**: (a ⊛ b) ⊛ c = a ⊛ (b ⊛ c)
- **Distributivity**: a ⊛ (b + c) = (a ⊛ b) + (a ⊛ c)
- **Inverse Relationship**: a ⊛ b ⊛ â ≈ b (where â is approximate inverse of a)

#### Unbinding Operation
Retrieval uses circular correlation with the approximate inverse:
```
c = a ⊛ b    (binding)
b' = c ⊛ â   (unbinding, where b' ≈ b)
```

### Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA)
General framework for computation with high-dimensional vectors:

#### Core Operations
- **Binding**: Combining vectors to create compositional structures
- **Superposition**: Adding vectors to create sets or unions
- **Similarity**: Measuring relatedness through dot products or cosine similarity
- **Normalization**: Maintaining vector magnitude constraints

#### Representational Capacity
For n-dimensional vectors and k items:
- **Storage Capacity**: O(n/log n) items can be reliably stored
- **Noise Tolerance**: Degradation is gradual with increasing storage load
- **Dimensionality Requirements**: Higher dimensions provide better capacity and noise tolerance

### Compositional Memory Architecture
Structured representation and processing of complex information:

#### Hierarchical Binding
Building complex structures through nested binding operations:
```
sentence = subject ⊛ SUBJECT + verb ⊛ VERB + object ⊛ OBJECT
scene = location ⊛ LOCATION + actors ⊛ ACTORS + actions ⊛ ACTIONS
```

#### Cleanup Memory
Associative memory for converting noisy vectors to clean prototypes:
- **Hetero-associative**: Maps between different vector spaces
- **Auto-associative**: Cleans up vectors within same space
- **Competitive Networks**: Winner-take-all dynamics for discrete decisions

#### Memory Traces and Episodes
Temporal sequence representation:
```
episode = event₁ ⊛ TIME₁ + event₂ ⊛ TIME₂ + ... + eventₙ ⊛ TIMEₙ
```
