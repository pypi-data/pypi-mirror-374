"""
ðŸŒ€ Core Module for Holographic Memory System
===========================================

This module provides the core functionality for Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR)
and Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) operations. It implements the foundational
algorithms from Tony Plate's research and modern extensions.

Main Components:
- HolographicMemory: Main memory system class
- HRROperations: Core binding and unbinding operations  
- AssociativeMemory: Associative memory with cleanup
- MemoryTrace: Individual memory trace management
- CompositionalHRR: Compositional structure operations

Based on:
- Plate (1995) "Holographic Reduced Representations"
- Hinton (1981) "Implementing Semantic Networks in Parallel Hardware"
