    Will create a spherical region containing the following molecules:

        +-------------+-------------+---------+
        |  Component  | Structure   |   Ratio |
        |-------------+-------------+---------|
        |    fluid    | c1ccccc1    |       1 |
        |    fluid    | O           |       3 |
        +-------------+-------------+---------+

    The dimensions of the region will be calculated from the density 0.9 g/ml.
    The number of molecules of the fluid will be obtained by rounding 300
    molecules to give the requested ratios of species.

Created a spherical region with a diameter of 32.69 Ã… with 300 fluid molecules

    +-------------+-------------+---------------+----------+------------+
    |  Component  | Structure   |   Requested % |   Number |   Actual % |
    |-------------+-------------+---------------+----------+------------|
    |    fluid    | c1ccccc1    |            25 |       75 |         25 |
    |    fluid    | O           |            75 |      225 |         75 |
    +-------------+-------------+---------------+----------+------------+

There are a total of 1575 atoms in the cell giving a density of 0.9 g/ml.
