> As of Summer 2025 COMPAS TNO is being refactored to work with COMPAS 2.0 and better integrate with the COMPAS MASONRY environment. A Legacy version is available at secondary branches.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE** ⚠️

**COMPAS TNO** is a Python package to find admissible thrust networks in masonry vaulted structures built in the [COMPAS](https://compas.dev/) framework.

Based on [Ricardo Maia Avelino](https://ricardoavelino.github.io/)'s doctoral thesis at ETH Zurich, this Package enables finding multi-objective particular internal stress solutions in masonry vaults, as the ones presented below.
