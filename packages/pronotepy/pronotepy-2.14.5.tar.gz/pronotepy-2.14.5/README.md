## Introduction

Pronotepy is a Python API wrapper for the PRONOTE student administration service. It mainly focuses on student accounts but has limited support for teacher accounts as well.
This project does **not** use the official HYPERPLANNING API provided by PRONOTE, which is inaccessible to students.

## About

### Dependencies

 - pycryptodome
 - beautifulsoup4
 - requests
 - autoslot

### Installation
#### Stable

Install directly from pypi using pip: `pip install -U pronotepy`

> [!NOTE]
If you are on Windows and have trouble with this command, use `py -3 -m pip install pronotepy`. You must have Python 3 installed on your machine.

#### Latest

You can install the latest version by installing directly from the repository:

`pip install -U git+https://github.com/bain3/pronotepy`

We cannot assure that the latest version will be working, but it might have features or bugfixes that are not yet released on pypi.

### Testing the package
To self test pronotepy run this command:

`python -m pronotepy.test_pronotepy`

*Please keep in mind that this uses the demo version of pronote and so it can't test every function.*

### Usage

> [!WARNING]
The usage part of this readme is for the latest version. If you are installing from pypi, please see the documentation linked at the beginning.

Here is an example script (homework shown in example.py):
```python
import pronotepy

import datetime
from pathlib import Path
import json

# load login from `python3 -m pronotepy.create_login` command.
# See quickstart in documentation for other login methods.
credentials = json.loads(Path("credentials.json").read_text())

client = pronotepy.Client.token_login(**credentials)

if client.logged_in: # check if client successfully logged in

    # save new credentials - IMPORTANT
    credentials = client.export_credentials()
    Path("credentials.json").write_text(json.dumps(credentials))

    nom_utilisateur = client.info.name # get users name
    print(f'Logged in as {nom_utilisateur}')

    # get the all the periods (may return multiple types like trimesters and
    # semesters but it doesn't really matter the api will get it anyway)
    periods = client.periods

    for period in periods:
        for grade in period.grades:  # iterate over all the grades
            print(f'{grade.grade}/{grade.out_of}')  # print out the grade in this style: 20/20
```

For any extra details, please see the documentation linked above.
