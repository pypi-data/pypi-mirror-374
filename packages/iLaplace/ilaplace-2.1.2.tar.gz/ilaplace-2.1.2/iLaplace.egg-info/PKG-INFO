# iLaplace

> A Simple Interface for Powerful Math

`iLaplace` is a lightweight Python wrapper around advanced symbolic and numerical math tools (`sympy`, `numpy` & `mpmath`) that provides a clean and intuitive interface for computing inverse Laplace transforms using Talbot's method.

I created this library to simplify the process of using the inverse Laplace transform, aiming to provide a **MATLAB-like experience within Python**. This means the output of my code in Python will be compared against a sample calculation in MathWorks MATLAB.

-----

## Why This Library?

If you've ever tried to compute inverse Laplace transforms numerically in Python, you've probably noticed:

  * `mpmath.invertlaplace()` is powerful but raw and low-level.
  * `sympy` gives symbolic transforms, but not numerical answers.
  * Combining them can be verbose and repetitive.

**In short: You focus on the math, we handle the machinery.**

## MATLAB vs. Python Comparison

Here is a sample calculation in MATLAB and its equivalent in Python using this library.

### MATLAB Example

```matlab
syms s t
X = (s+3)/((s+1)^2 + (s^2+9));
V = vpa(ilaplace(X, s, t));
t0   = 5.2643;
Volt = double(subs(V, t, t0));
disp(Volt)
```

The output in MATLAB is `-0.020100091042301`.

### Python Equivalent with iLaplace

```python
import iLaplace as il
import sympy as sp
t, s = sp.symbols('t s')
X = (s+3)/((s+1)**2 + (s**2+9))
t0 = 5.2643
Answer = il.inverse_laplace(X, t0)
print(Answer)
```

And the output is `-0.020100091042300372`.

### 2nd Example:

```python
import iLaplace as il
import sympy as sp
import numpy as np
s, t = sp.symbols('s t')
t0 = 5.2643
X = (3) / ((s**2) +  (3**2))
Answer = il.inverse_laplace(X, t0)
print(Answer)
```

the output is `-0.08483425637752962`.

### MATLAB Example

```matlab
syms s t
format long
X= 3 / (s^2 + 3^2);
V = vpa(ilaplace(X, s, t));
t0   = 5.2643;
Volt = double(subs(V, t, t0));
disp(Volt)
```

and The output in MATLAB is `-0.084834643101466`.


### 3rd Example:

```python
import iLaplace as il
import sympy as sp
t, s = sp.symbols('t s')
t0 = 5.2643
X = ((s + 3) / ((s + 3)**2 + 25)
              + 1 / (s + 2)**3
              + sp.log((s + 10) / s))
Answer = il.inverse_laplace(X, t0)
print(Answer)
```

the output is `0.19032962256026703`.

### MATLAB Example

```matlab
syms s t
X = (s + 3) / ((s + 3)^2 + 25) ...
    + 1 / (s + 2)^3 ...
    + log((s + 10) / s);  
V = vpa(ilaplace(X, s, t));
t0   = 5.2643;
Volt = double(subs(V, t, t0));
disp(Volt)
```

and The output in MATLAB is `0.190329629407706`.

### 4th Example:

```python
import iLaplace as il
import sympy as sp
t, s = sp.symbols('t s')
t0 = 5.2643
#######################################
X1 = ((s + 3) / ((s + 3)**2 + 25)
              + 1 / (s + 2)**3
              + sp.log((s + 10) / s))
X2 = (s+3)/((s+1)**2 + (s**2+9))
X3 = (3) / ((s**2) +  (3**2))
#######################################
X= X1 + X2 + X3
Answer = il.inverse_laplace(X, t0)
print(Answer)
```

the output is `0.08539527514043704`.

### MATLAB Example

```matlab
syms s t
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
X1 = (s + 3) / ((s + 3)^2 + 25) ...
    + 1 / (s + 2)^3 ...
    + log((s + 10) / s);
X2 = (s+3)/((s+1)^2 + (s^2+9));
X3 = 3 / (s^2 + 3^2);
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
X = X1 + X2 + X3;
V = vpa(ilaplace(X, s, t));
t0   = 5.2643;
Volt = double(subs(V, t, t0));
disp(Volt)
```
