# This example is intended to be used together with the rx_tx_loop example of the Python companion library
# ataraxis-transport-layer-pc. When used correctly, the example code will continuously transmit and receive data
# between the microcontroller and the PC.

# This example is intended to be sued together with the quickstart loop for the companion library:

# Instantiates a new TransportLayer object. Most class initialization arguments should scale with any microcontroller.
# However, you do need to provide the USB port name (can be discovered via 'axtl-ports' CLI command)
# and the microcontroller's Serial buffer size (can be obtained from the microcontroller's manufacturer). Check the API
# documentation website if you want to fine-tune other class parameters to better match your use case.

# Note, buffer size 8192 assumes you are using Teensy 3.0+. Most Arduino boards have buffers capped at 64 or 256
# bytes. While this demonstration will likely work even if the buffer size is not valid, it is critically
# important to set this value correctly for production runtimes.

# Similarly, the baudrate here will likely need to be adjusted for UART microcontrollers. If baudrate is not set
# correctly, the communication will not be stable (many packets will be corrupted in transmission). You can use this
# https://wormfood.net/avrbaudcalc.php tool to find the best baudrate for your AVR board or consult the manufacturer's
# documentation.
