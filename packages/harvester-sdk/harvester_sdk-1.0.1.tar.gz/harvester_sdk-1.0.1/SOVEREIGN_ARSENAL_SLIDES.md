## Slide 12: Closing

**Quantum Encoding Ltd**
- Where Performance Meets Sovereignty
- Building the infrastructure of tomorrow
- Not servicing clients, but creating products

**Our GCP needs:**
- GPU instances for Chimera & Hyperion
- Compute Engine for distributed systems
- Cloud Run for microservices
- BigQuery for analytics

*We are exactly the type of company the Cloud Startup Program was designed for.*
