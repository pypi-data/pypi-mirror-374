## Executive
summary

### 5G and edge computing are on the rise

The growing number of smart devices, the need for faster processing and the increased pressure on networks drive the edge computing market.

Edge computing , combined with 5G, creates opportunities to enhance digital experiences, improve performance, support data security and enable continuous operations in every industry. Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to where data is created by people, places and things.

### Gartner estimates that by 2025, 75 percent of data will be processed outside the traditional data center or cloud. 1

Forward-looking companies want to unlock the potential of untapped data created by the growth of connected devices to seize new business opportunities, increase operational efficiency and improve customer experiences.

Edge computing can help address Industry 4.0 challenges and enable connected experiences.

Imagine that you’re a manufacturer and you’re trying to deal with the potential cost of outages in your production line—costs that might occur if any of your equipment goes down and stops the production process. Or imagine that you are an automobile manufacturer trying to engage your clients with a better driving experience.  These  industry examples  can be enhanced and extended using edge computing.

In the past, the promise of cloud and AI was to automate and speed innovation by deriving actionable insights from data. However, the scale and complexity of data created by connected devices may strain network and infrastructure capabilities.

### IDC predicts that by 2023, half of the newly deployed on-premises infrastructure will be in critical edge locations rather than corporate data centers, up from less than 10% today. 2

## Edge computing benefits

### Edge computing, combined with 5G, creates opportunities for new products, platforms and experiences in every industry

By leveraging the computational capacity of edge devices, gateways and networks, you can continue to take advantage of the principles of dynamic allocation of resources and continuous delivery that are inherent to cloud computing.

With edge computing, today’s businesses have the potential to virtualize the cloud beyond the four walls of the data center. Workloads created in the cloud, including some of the more modern forms of AI and analytics, can now be migrated out toward the edge. Where appropriate, data generated at the edge can be cleansed and optimized and brought back to the cloud.

- Better data control and lower costs by minimizing data transport to central hubs and reducing vulnerabilities
- Faster insights and actions by tapping into more sources of data and processing that data at the edge
- Continuous operations by enabling systems that run autonomously, even when disconnected to reduce disruption and lower costs

IBM has a view of edge computing that spans many industries and multiple tiers, and includes open technologies and standards like Docker and Kubernetes.

The edge computing platform from IBM   spans private cloud and enterprise environments and network compute spaces as well as on-premises gateways, controllers and servers, and intelligent devices such as robots, connected vehicles or other products.

Centrally, hyper-scale public clouds, hybrid clouds, colocated managed data centers and traditional enterprise IT data centers will continue to serve as aggregation points for data, analytics and back-end data processing.

Public, private and content-delivery networks are transforming from simple pipes to higher-value hosting environments for applications—a form of edge network cloud.

## Edge computing risks and responsibilities

### Enterprises with edge environments must deal with the issues of massive scale, variability and rate of change

Edge computing breaks down the neat physical boundaries of the cloud data center—forcing us to think about issues such as security, scale, management, ownership and compliance. More importantly, it multiplies the scaling issues of cloud-based management techniques.

Edge networks increase the number of compute nodes by an order of magnitude. Edge gateways increase that by another order of magnitude and edge devices increase the number even more. If DevOps is critical to managing a hyper-scale cloud infrastructure, then zero-ops (that is, operations without any human intervention) is critical to managing the massive scale that edge computing represents.

At that scale, change is constant and explosive. Networks are being reconfigured to work around congestion on a continuous basis. Edge gateways are being updated with new features and processes. Edge devices are being moved around, changing ownership and being repurposed or reprioritized. This level of churn is practically business as usual. Moreover, intelligent equipment, or edge devices, are often shared, so a user cannot be expected to manage the compute available on them.

## What’s involved in edge computing?

### It must be possible to deploy, update, monitor and recover edge compute space without human intervention

Edge management processes must be fully automated , so enterprises can make decisions on their own about what work needs to be placed where, and recognize and recover from changing conditions without intervention.

The system must have a deep awareness of the nature, location and purpose of different devices with different capabilities and different uses—and be able to use that awareness to make informed, policy-driven decisions.

These are all issues that need to be considered and addressed to enable the other advantages of edge computing.

### Terms and trends:

- Hybrid cloud computing:  Traditional hyper-scale, public clouds—such as IBM Cloud® and other cloud offerings from providers like Microsoft, Amazon and Google—as well as private clouds deployed in data centers on-premises and off-premises.
- 5G network:  During the transition to 5G, many public network providers are expanding their infrastructures to include general-purpose computing services. The edge network itself is potentially multitiered and composed of regional data centers, central offices and hub micro-data centers. Telcos are transforming these tiers in their core network to host application workloads using cloud technologies within the network edge.
- Edge servers:  Servers, gateways and controllers acting as edge servers are often deployed in factories, warehouses, hotels and retail stores to provide local compute capacity for operations. These resources may or may not be clustered, but still support critical business processes.
- Edge devices:  The number of devices that contain enough computational capacity to do work is growing rapidly. These devices commonly have sufficient CPU power, RAM and local storage to run a Linux ®  operating system.
- IoT devices:  Most traditional IoT devices are closed, fixed-function devices. They are typically integrated with sensors for collecting data that is transmitted upstream to other aggregation points—traditionally the cloud.
- Mobile devices:  Mobile devices play an important role in edge networks. They are distinct from other edge devices because they typically belong to an individual who assumes personal responsibility for them. Mobile devices that run iOS or Android operating systems may refuse to run container software that was not acquired through their app stores.

[5G and Edge Computing: What's Next](/topic/5g-and-edge-computing-whats-next/) Picture our techscape before 2005 and then our technology environment today. We are living in a totally mobile-first world that relies on the fact that nearly everyone has a smartphone. Entire industries have changed, been enabled, and been disrupted, all because of the smartphone.

Each mobile G generation has changed our world. Substantially. Universally. So when we look at 5G now, which is just barely getting started, we're looking at more than another telecom technology. We're looking at the harbinger of another massive change to the world we live in.

## How we got to 5G: A look back at 2G, 3G, and 4G

2G ushered in texting. 3G brought us apps and app stores. 4G brought us our mobile-first world.

In 2005, the Palm Treo used 2G to communicate data with the cellular system. Apps were installed by plugging the Treo into a PC or Mac and transferring them via a cable. Data speeds were 40-230Kbps (kilobits per second). You could, theoretically push that to 384Kbps with edge service, but I certainly didn't get that performance on the highway. So in practice, 2G got you texting and some MMS pictures and, if you were lucky, some very slow-loading web pages if the site had mobile super-plain versions available.

Fast forward to summer 2008, Apple released the iPhone 3G and the Apple App Store. With the App Store came one-click installation, allowing everyone to manage their own apps -- and apps thrived. 3G allowed  speeds of 384Kbps to 2Mbps (megabits per second), which made it practical to download an app on the phone. Though web searches were fairly slow, they functioned. 3G also provided better positioning data, which made apps like Uber possible. Smartphones were being used but were still not fully mainstream.

Jump to 2012 when Apple released the iPhone 5. It's running 4G/LTE (LTE is a version of 4G). This is when everything changed. People stopped looking where they were going when they walked, and instead began to stare into their phone screens. People stopped interacting with family members at the dinner table and were instead glued to their phone screens. With the jump in speed from a max of about 2Mbps to speeds between 100Mbps (while in motion) and 1Gbps (when stationary), everyone had broadband in their pockets. This enabled HD video, highly interactive mobile games, social media at all levels, video conferencing, and pretty much everything else we rely on with our phones today.

In truth, the little Palm Treo was still a smart phone. So, it's not the actual phone or the apps that have enabled radical digital transformation, but instead, mobile transmission speed.

## What is 5G? (and why it's special)

5G has already been here for a few years. Consumers are just beginning to see benefits, but businesses and industries have already begun another generational transformation due to the availability of 5G. I will discuss what 5G is, what it can do for us, and how this new generation of mobile data is transforming the world. There are four technological advances that 5G offers: transmission speed, latency, robustness, and density.

### Transmission speed

We talked about transmission speed earlier in this special report. It's how fast data can move up and down the pipes. In practical terms,  Verizon says  that 5G offers typical speeds that are up to 10 times faster than 4G. Think of it as having better-than-Wi-Fi speeds everywhere you go.

### Latency

Latency is a different thing. It's not how big your pipe is (as in how much data it can hold). It's more about how fast you can turn that pipe on and off.

Most computer users learned about latency back when we started playing first person shooters. Sometimes a shot was dead to rights. But sometimes the shot wouldn't connect and suddenly the display would update, with a target standing five feet to the left or right. That's latency in action. What users saw on screen wasn't exactly what was happening in the server.

Now, think about latency in self-driving cars. It's rush hour on the 101 and suddenly, there's an accident. You want all the cars heading to the accident to immediately learn of it so they can begin breaking. If it takes 2-3 seconds for that information to pass from the scene of the accident to the other cars on the road, in can mean disaster.

A car driving at 60 miles per hour (6.56 km/h) can travel about 264 feet (80.47 meters) in 2-3 seconds. That's about 17 car lengths. A reaction time of 17 car lengths could be deadly.

With 5G,  latency will drop  to about 1/10th of what it is with 4G. Over time, that's expected to improve even more. All that is to say network responsiveness can be much faster.

### Robustness

Have you ever had a conversation with a friend when the signal glitches in and out? Or find that your Internet connection works one minute, and then it's gone the next? These problems are caused when the connection between your mobile device and the network fails.

Most of the time, though, the failure isn't particularly long-lasting. Connectivity might drop off as you drive into a tunnel or you walk into a room with too many metallic signal obstructions. Unfortunately, at least with 4G, even a fraction of a second's interruption can cause the network to disconnect.

5G improves on that. It is better able to withstand fluctuations and therefore better able to sustain a stable connection, even in less-than-ideal conditions. Technologies like  Massive MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output) and beamforming  help sustain signals, even in very crowded environments.

In this context, the signal is more robust. Additionally, 5G is able to reconnect faster due to the prevalence of edge computing (more on that in a bit) and better handover protocols.

### Density

Verizon says that the theoretical maximum number of operational 4G devices in a square kilometer (38% of a square mile) is about 10,000. By contrast, 5G should allow as many as a million connected devices in the same space.

On some level, having that many networked devices around us is pretty daunting, but I have more than 50 connected devices just in my home. We do like our gadgets. And, as self-driving cars and other Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices proliferate, we'll have more and more. Being able to support as many connected devices as necessary will be key to being able to count on 5G connectivity when it's deployed.

After all, the last thing you want to hear your car say when you ask it to drive you somewhere is,"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

## Power at the edge

There's a lot more about 5G that gives it its superpowers.

Instead of relying solely on large, high-powered cell towers (as 4G does), 5G will run off both those towers and a ton of small cell sites that can be clustered together. This is how 5G achieves its population density.

5G is also supposed to be more energy efficient. As such, the communications component of IoT devices won't drain as much power, resulting in longer battery life for connected devices.

There's also a ton of AI and machine learning in 5G implementations. 5G nodes and interface  devices deployed on the edge, away from central hubs. They utilize AI and machine learning to analyze communications performance, and use AI to bandwidth-shape communications, to wring as much performance out of the hardware as possible.

You're familiar with the term "cloud computing." We've all used cloud services, services that run on a server someplace rather than on our desktop computers or mobile devices. The cloud, of course, isn't really a cloud. Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and others operate massive data centers packed with thousands upon thousands of servers. Soft and fluffy, the cloud is not.

But we call it the cloud because it's all the computing that takes place in that amorphous space between all our PCs and mobile devices. Back in the day, when IT folks drew network diagrams, that connectivity in the middle — the stuff the IT folks themselves didn't manage — was drawn as a simple cloud. And so we got the term "cloud computing."

All of this brings us to the concept of edge computing. Think of it this way: if it's not in the middle, it's at the edge. It's an oversimplification, but edge computing describes the practice of placing a ton of computing power at the very edge of the network, at the point of impact with the application. In a factory, that would be computing located right in or near the factory. In the case of self-driving cars, that would be a boatload (er, a carload) of computing power right inside the vehicle itself, as well as more that might live along the roadways and intersections.

Why is edge computing important? The answer is simple: physics. It takes time for bits to travel from the point of an application (say, the sensors on the front of your car) all the way to the data center, and back. Each packet might jump across many networks, traverse geographical zones, and pass through a range of firewalls.

With today's networks, that process is quick. But it's not "you're about to crash into that car that just suddenly stopped in front of you" quick. Edge processing puts enough processing power, often assisted by AI and machine learning, right near where it's needed. Sure, sometime later in the day, the edge servers might upload their processing history to the cloud, but right at the moment that something is about to go haywire, the edge gear is there to step in, in real time — and before it's too late.

Much of this is doable with 5G for a variety of reasons. We talked about improved transmission speed, latency, robustness, and density above. 5G pulls that off by replacing cell towers with lots of little nodes. As such, the 5G connection is likely to be far closer to the edge than most 4G connections.

## 5G in use

5G has a lot of enterprise and productivity applications. But it also provides benefits to smartphone users overall. A 5G-enabled phone offers faster download and upload speeds, improved connectivity, enhanced streaming and gaming, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) support, facilitation of IoT devices, energy efficiency, global roaming, enhanced voice calls, and support for new services and applications.

To give you a better feel for 5G in use beyond smartphones, we'll look at five very different companies and how they're using 5G now to improve their operations and offerings.

### Car wash systems provider

Cradlepoint  is a 5G networking gear provider that's a subsidiary of Ericsson. James Weaver, Senior Director at Cradlepoint told us about one of their users, Motor City Wash Works.

Motor City Wash Works  is a manufacturer of automated car washes that offers a turn-key as-a-service operating model. Managing costs from time-to-operation and maintenance are key to generating profitability. Motor City built its car wash infrastructure to automate and monitor everything from the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) controlling all the motor operations, point of sale (POS) systems, and security cameras.

Motor City found that the slower installation time and lesser reliability of conventional connectivity got in the way of making their business model work. To solve those issues, the company chose a solution that included 5G cellular in order to gain its rapid deployment, agility, performance, and reliability benefits.

Motor City is running lighter edge applications on the routers not only for better latency, but also for redundancy and resiliency. . Because Motor City runs an as-a-service model, its goal is to discover and correct operations and network problems before the car wash owners even know about them.

Think about it: car washes seem benign, but if you were in a car inside a car wash and those giant robots were to run amok, it wouldn't be pretty. Being able to manage those devices automatically and in real time can protect customers, their vehicles, and the car wash's reputation.

Using edge computing, Motor City Wash Works also processes, translates, and transmits industrial automation data to each car wash management team via dashboards. They are able to securely encrypt and protect their customers' credit card data while maintaining integrations with a number of POS platforms and operate seamlessly with reliable connectivity, even if total communication loss were to occur.

### Field service operations

Another company using 5G technology is field service software provider  FieldCircle . Yogesh Choudhary, cofounder and CEO of FieldCircle describes how his company relies on the robustness benefits of 5G.

"For me, one major problem it solves is that it enables applications to function even when there's limited or no internet connectivity," Choudhary told ZDNET. "This has been gold for testing products that need to continue working in remote environments such as field operations or remote monitoring solutions, which has greatly benefitted our FieldCircle clients and improved our overall reputation with them."

### Custom applications with better network performance

TechAhead  is a company that builds mobile app solutions for clients. ZDNET spoke to Vikas Kaushik, TechAhead's CEO. His company is employing edge computing and 5G to improve mobile app development procedures. With 5G, the company can now give real-time data synchronization, smooth remote collaboration, and what he describes as "incredibly quick content delivery" within the apps TechAhead provides to clients.

Kaushik says, "We are resolving the issue of latency and data bottlenecks that frequently hindered user experiences in the past through this integration. We can provide our clients with lightning-fast app performance and unbroken connectivity thanks to 5G and edge computing, guaranteeing their users enjoy a positive and interesting experience."

He told ZDNET, "With the help of this technology, we are now able to construct high-quality, data-intensive apps that go above and beyond client expectations."

### Supplier of life-giving coffee

Home Grounds  is a critical infrastructure provider (and by "critical infrastructure," I mean that they provide coffee beans and brewing gear). There is no higher calling.

Alex Mastin, CEO and founder of Home Grounds told ZDNET, "I've noticed a real difference in connectivity between employees who have access to 5G, and those who are still waiting for it to be implemented in their area. Those who are using 5G and edge computing are finding it increases the ease and efficiency of their work."

Coffee also increases the ease and efficiency of work. Just sayin'. And yes, I can quit anytime I want. Yeah, that's the ticket.

Mastin reports, "Using a combination of 5G and edge computing has been beneficial for collecting, analyzing, and storing data, and we've been able to use these insights to enhance our business, segmenting our audience more effectively, and tailoring our marketing accordingly. It has also supported personalization, which has made a significant difference to our performance. Another added benefit is that it supports security, which is a major priority for our business."

### Supply chain logistics

We also had the opportunity to speak with Orlando Remédios, cofounder and CEO of  Sensefinity , an IoT company providing end-to-end visibility for complex logistic processes, from monitoring production to tracking the goods in real-time through global supply chains. Sensefinity provides real-time visibility, alarms, and predictive analytics.

Remédios told ZDNET that 5G and edge services in the logistics industry allow for real-time visibility in internal supply chain and logistics operations.

"5G allows for industrial companies or large sites like sea ports to create their own private networks where they can massively deploy IoT-connected devices," said Remédios. This goes to our discussion earlier about the increase in device density supported by 5G.

Remédios also told us that all these connected IoT devices help, "Identify critical assets in supply-chain operations and supervise them in real-time, thus providing real-time visibility at a low price-point that is only possible via the deployment of 5G networks."

### Self-driving cars

Self-driving cars are a big application of 5G. Personally, I'm not sure I ever want to give up the steering wheel and gas pedal, but with aging being " the top global demographic trend ," self-driving cars promise to provide older folks with agency far beyond the time their reflexes diminish to the point where they can't safely drive on their own. But, we won't really be able to usher in the era of cars that drive us until 5G is widely deployed.

## To 6G and beyond

In addition to 5G, you're going to start hearing some vendors start talking about 6G, because of course they will.

Here's the main detail you need to keep in mind: 5G is for the 2020s, and 6G is expected in the 2030s. 6G is the logical extension of the idea that if we have good technology today, we should be working on better technology for tomorrow.

Nothing about 6G is official or even definite. While labs are experimenting with future technologies, 6G isn't close to real. That said, it's expected that 6G will offer improved bandwidth, maybe even to the terabit/second level. Likewise, expect latency to be reduced even more than 5G offers, and expect support for yet more device density.

If AR/VR and self-driving vehicles actually become practical, 6G is probably the technology that will take those applications from functional curiosities to the mainstream. Finally, 6G may increase coverage area even more, even to the point of going underwater or bringing networking to IoT devices located outside Earth's atmosphere.

But like I said, 6G is all very speculative. If you want to know more, be sure to read the other excellent articles in this ZDNET Special Feature. There's a lot of really good information presented on a wide range of topics by some of our best experts on the future of connectivity.

Your cloud infrastructure works fine…until it doesn’t. Even as 5G and edge computing adoption grows, many IT teams still battle 50ms latency spikes, watch applications lag and scramble to maintain service levels when IoT sensors can’t relay critical alerts.

Together, 5G and edge computing  reduce latency issues to 1ms  by processing data right where it’s created. Imagine running real-time analytics without saturating your network bandwidth or managing containerized applications that respond as fast as local installations.

This article explains how 5G edge computing works, why IT teams combine these technologies and what challenges you’ll face during implementation. You’ll see how different organizations use edge computing today, what the future holds for edge deployments and which security considerations matter most for your planning.

## What is 5G edge computing?

5G edge computing pairs 5G networks with local processing power to handle data where it’s created. This setup gives you the processing capabilities of the cloud without the latency penalties of sending data back and forth to distant data centers.

Edge computing  puts processing power at your network’s edge, right where your data generates. In mobile networks, this is often called mobile edge computing (MEC) or multi-access edge computing, where processing happens within the mobile network infrastructure.

Your applications run on local edge nodes rather than in distant data centers, whether they’re mobile edge nodes in 5G networks or other edge locations. These nodes process, filter and analyze data on-site, sending only necessary information to the cloud. This approach cuts network traffic and delivers the fast response times that modern applications need.

### What is 5G?

5G is cellular network technology that outperforms previous generations in three key areas: bandwidth, number of connected devices and response time. It delivers speeds up to 20Gbps, handles up to 1 million connected devices per square kilometer and responds in less than 1ms. For IT teams, 5G’s network slicing feature also allows you to create dedicated virtual networks with guaranteed performance levels, which are essential for running critical applications.

## Why use mobile edge computing and 5G together?

Mobile edge computing and 5G create a powerful combination that solves several key IT challenges. Here’s why they work better as a team.

### Network efficiency

Organizations struggling with data-heavy applications often find their networks overwhelmed. When hundreds of devices stream data to cloud servers, the flood of raw information consumes bandwidth and creates bottlenecks that slow down time-sensitive operations.

5G edge computing processes this data locally, sending only relevant information to central systems. A network that once pushed 500GB daily now transfers just 25GB, freeing bandwidth for critical applications that need instant response times. Teams get faster access to important data while routine processing happens automatically at the edge.

### Consistent performance

Applications running in the cloud face unpredictable performance as response times swing from 10ms to 100ms throughout the day. These variations force IT teams to build in delay tolerances that limit the capabilities of real-time systems and frustrate users expecting instant responses.

5G edge computing stabilizes response times at under 1ms by processing data locally. Your applications perform consistently regardless of internet conditions or cloud server loads, letting you build reliable services users can count on.

### Resource optimization

Cloud costs spike when every sensor, camera and IoT device sends raw data to central servers for processing. This traditional approach wastes computing resources on routine data handling while creating unnecessary storage expenses for information you might never need.

Edge computing lets you process data where it makes sense. Local nodes handle immediate tasks like real-time monitoring and filtering, while cloud systems focus on long-term analytics and data aggregation. This division cuts cloud costs while improving application performance, giving you more value from your IT investments.

### Smarter scaling

When mission-critical applications share network resources with routine operations, performance becomes unpredictable. IT teams spend countless hours prioritizing traffic and preventing important workloads from competing with basic tasks.

5G edge computing eliminates these conflicts through network slicing and local processing. Critical applications get dedicated capacity and computing resources while routine tasks run on separate channels. Your teams can scale different workloads independently without worrying about resource competition.

## Avoid common edge computing pitfalls

The complexity of edge computing creates unique challenges that IT teams must address early. While the benefits are clear, success requires careful planning around both technical constraints and business requirements.

### Physical environment constraints

Edge computing devices must operate in environments your traditional IT infrastructure was never designed to handle. From ruggedized hardware requirements to limited power and cooling resources, each location presents unique challenges. Remote sites without onsite staff mean even simple maintenance tasks can turn into complex operations.

Successful deployments require planning for USB peripherals, display systems and various communication protocols while ensuring your hardware can handle environmental stresses. This often means longer maintenance windows and careful consideration of physical access limitations.

### Hardware lifecycle management

Unlike cloud infrastructure that you can upgrade regularly, edge devices often need to run for years without hardware changes. This extended lifecycle affects everything from initial hardware selection to ongoing maintenance strategies.

IT teams must balance the appeal of smaller, cheaper edge nodes against the reality of supporting them across hundreds of locations. The true costs emerge when you consider the logistics of physical deployment, tiered hardware approaches and maintaining consistent performance levels across diverse environments.

### Network and connectivity challenges

Edge deployments rely heavily on public networks that offer neither the reliability nor the security of your data center connections. Low bandwidth, high latency and intermittent connectivity force teams to rethink traditional approaches to application architecture.

Your edge solutions must handle these constraints while maintaining security and performance. This means implementing robust local processing capabilities and designing applications that work gracefully even when network conditions deteriorate.

### Operational complexity

Managing distributed edge environments demands fresh approaches to IT operations. Traditional tools designed for centralized control break down when facing hundreds of remote sites, each with unique requirements and constraints.

Success requires automation-first management tools built specifically for edge environments. Your teams need solutions that handle everything from zero-touch deployments to remote diagnostics while complying with regulatory frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA. This operational shift affects not just technology choices, but also team structures and skill requirements.

## See how edge computing solves real problems

IT teams across industries are putting 5G edge computing to the test and the results speak for themselves. These   edge computing use cases  show how organizations solve real technical challenges by processing data where it’s created, not where it’s stored.

### From 5 minutes to 1 second

An automotive plant’s quality control system was drowning in data. Its HD cameras generated 1.2TB of footage daily, overwhelming its network and causing costly inspection delays.

By deploying edge nodes with machine learning capabilities at each inspection point, it now processes visual data instantly. Defects that once took 5 minutes to identify are caught in under a second and their network bandwidth usage dropped significantly.

### Emergency response that can’t wait

A metropolitan emergency services team faced a critical challenge: their cloud-based traffic monitoring system couldn’t respond fast enough during emergencies. Installing 5G-enabled edge processors at key intersections changed everything.

Now, AI algorithms analyze traffic patterns locally and adjust signals immediately when emergency vehicles approach. Response times dropped from 8 minutes to under 3 minutes—a difference that saves lives.

### When patient data needs to stay put

A hospital’s radiology department struggled with two competing demands: instant access to medical images and strict data privacy requirements.

Its solution? Edge servers that process and render 3D medical images right in the radiology department. Doctors now view complex scans immediately without raw data ever leaving the premises, while IT maintains full HIPAA compliance.

### Turning store cameras into instant insights

A retail chain’s loss prevention team wanted to stop theft in real-time, not after reviewing overnight footage. Adding edge computing capabilities to their existing security cameras allows them to process video streams at each store instantly.

Its system spots suspicious behavior as it happens, while saving $50,000 monthly in cloud storage costs. Better security, lower costs and no more network congestion — all because the data stays local.

## Make your edge computing future-ready

The next phase of 5G edge computing focuses on three key areas that will reshape how IT teams design and manage distributed systems.

### Private 5G networks redefine control

Organizations building private 5G networks gain direct control over their edge computing environments. These networks let you set precise latency requirements, manage bandwidth allocation and keep sensitive data within your infrastructure. The result? Complete visibility and control over your edge operations without relying on public infrastructure.

### Edge devices get smarter with AI

Edge devices now run sophisticated machine learning models locally instead of sending data to the cloud. This shift means your team can deploy AI-powered analytics, monitoring and automation directly at the edge while maintaining strict data privacy. Think predictive maintenance that spots issues before they cause downtime. Or security systems that detect threats without exposing data beyond your network.

### Applications strengthen for edge-first deployment

A new class of applications is emerging that treats edge computing as a primary architecture rather than an add-on feature. These applications handle intermittent connectivity gracefully, distribute processing intelligently between edge and cloud resources and maintain performance even when network conditions change. For IT teams, this means simpler deployment and more reliable edge operations.

The message for IT infrastructure planning is clear: prepare your systems and teams for increasingly distributed operations. Success at the edge requires rethinking traditional approaches to application architecture, security and resource management.

## 5G edge computing: Final thoughts

5G edge computing isn’t just about faster networks or local processing — it’s about rethinking how your IT infrastructure handles data. By processing information where it’s created, you reduce latency, strengthen security and maintain control over sensitive data.

The challenges are real: distributed security, hardware costs and new operational demands require careful planning. But organizations across industries are already seeing the benefits. Manufacturing plants catch defects instantly and hospitals view medical scans in real time — tasks that traditional cloud processing can’t handle.

## 5G edge computing FAQs

### How will 5G affect edge computing?

5G reduces edge computing response times from 100ms to under 1ms by processing data at the source. This lets IT teams run AI workloads, video analytics and sensor processing locally instead of in distant data centers. Network slicing also allows dedicated bandwidth for critical edge applications, ensuring consistent performance during peak loads.

### What is the difference between edge computing and cloud computing?

Edge computing processes data within 100 meters of its source, while cloud computing sends data to centers often 100+ miles away. Edge computing responds in 1–10ms for real-time applications like autonomous vehicles, whereas cloud computing typically takes 50–100ms. Edge nodes also reduce bandwidth costs by filtering raw data locally, sending only essential information to cloud servers.

### Does 5G edge computing securely protect sensitive data?

5G edge computing keeps sensitive data more secure by processing it locally instead of sending it across public networks. Each edge node includes dedicated security controls — from encryption to access management — while network slicing creates isolated channels for different data types. This local processing approach means sensitive information stays within your infrastructure, reducing exposure to external threats.

## Exploring the edge: a must for 5G success

Learn to capture the unique opportunities of edge computing - greater performance, reliability, data sovereignty plus reduced cost and bandwidth for the transport network. [Download your playbook](/49f4a5/assets/local/edge-computing/doc/edge-computing-deployment-report-2023.pdf) Edge computing is all about bringing things closer together - a shift which is essential to meet the networking and computing demands of a connected 5G world. Learn what it is, and how it can give you an edge over the competition.

Edge computing is a distributed framework in which compute capabilities (such as the processing, analysis and storage of data for an application) are moved to the 'edge' of a network, geographically closer to where the data is being generated or consumed.

This means shorter distances for data to travel, as well as less data being sent back and forth between devices and centralized data centers and congesting the network. As a result, edge computing delivers benefits such as low latency and high bandwidth, plus more control over data sovereignty and handling.

Already understand edge and thinking about deployment? Move on to something more your speed and gain expert guidance for the path ahead.

When trying to understand edge computing, the 'edge' can seem like a vague and undefined place. But the site of an 'edge' is actually very specific - it just depends on the particular use case and its needs and characteristics. The real question then should be: Where is the edge?

Edge computing infrastructure can be deployed in four main locations, each offering different capabilities - the extended public edge, the network edge, the private edge and the gateway edge.

#### Private edge

In a private edge, computing and storage resources are often deployed at an enterprise premises such as a factory. Edge computing resources can be standalone or integrated with a  private network  and software-defined wide-area network (SD-WAN). These often have third party applications running on an enterprise proprietary stack or third-party private cloud.

#### Network edge

In a network edge, computing and storage resources are distributed across communication service provider (CSP) premises, between national, regional and local access sites. These can be standalone or integrated with the mobile cloud (running both telecom and third-party workloads). Edge compute can be seen as an extension of the CSPs existing network capabilities.

#### Public edge

In an extended public edge, computing and storage resources are distributed from central cloud sites located outside the CSP's premises, for example at a co-location site or a hyperscale cloud provider (HCP) data center. Site and cloud infrastructure is owned by HCPs or third-party cloud providers and others such as information or operational technology (IT or OT) players.

#### Gateway edge

Gateway edge is where small computing and storage resources are deployed at an enterprise or consumer-facing premises, or within mobile physical objects, for example trains, ambulances or private vehicles. Gateway edge also includes  wireless WAN  router-based edge solutions primarily used in enterprise sites, vehicles, Internet of Things (IoT) applications and more.

#### Higher performance and efficiency

With data being processed nearby, there is less latency than with centralized data centers, as well as increased performance and bandwidth for the transport network.

#### Data sovereignty

Comply fully with jurisdictional data regulations and sovereignty laws by allowing data to be processed locally, or within a particular geographical region.

#### Improved Quality of Experience (QoE)

Elevate QoE and enable innovative solutions that use real-time analytics for video processing, low latency for remote equipment control or offloading computational heavy functions to enable slim, lightweight devices such as extended reality (XR) glasses.

#### Advanced automation

Real-time data analysis and insights provide a platform for next-level automation, using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for time-critical decision-making.

#### Enhanced security and privacy

On premise edge computing helps insulate those using private networks from cyberattacks and threats, while also enjoying less risk of data being intercepted in transit, improving security and privacy.

| Demand driver | Edge capability in 5G |
| Application latency | With the app closer to the user and 5G radio, the latency can be reduced, supporting new use cases. |
| Application exposure | The new 5G core will also offer application exposure for edge deployments. |
| Transport offload | 5G bandwidths may increase traffic further. Service delivery from the edge will minimize the backhaul traffic. |
| Processing offload | Application processing at the edge will offload devices at central datacenters while preserving user experience. |

Manufacturing, healthcare and gaming and entertainment are three of the top vertical industries with enormous potential when it comes to edge computing. However, the early maturity level and long time-to-market common in the manufacturing and healthcare industries means the reality looks slightly different.

Gaming and entertainment use cases stand out among the most advanced and market-ready to date, together with real-time analytics, autonomous and connected vehicles and video optimization.

| Use cases (non-exhaustive) | General overview | Private edge | Network edge |
| CDN-related cases | Latency: 100ms-1s+. Bandwidth: high |  |  |
| Video processing | Latency: 100-200ms. Bandwidth: high. Sofety and regulations |  |  |
| Manufacturing. heavy industry plants applications | Latency: 1ms-1s. Bandwidth: variable. Reliability, regulations, data privacy |  |  |
| Business park and city offices, retail shops | Latency: 30ms-1s. Bandwidth: variable. Reliability, safety |  |  |
| Cloud gaming services | Latency: 30ms-1s. Bandwidth: variable. Reliability, safety |  |  |
| Data collection and processing (including AI/ML) | Latency: 100ms-1s. Bandwidth high. Data processing distributed |  |  |
| Vehicles | Latency: 10-100ms. Bandwidth: mid/high. From private cars to AGVs |  |  |
| XR(AR/VR/MR) | Latency: 10-50ms. Bandwidth: high. Availability and complex processing |  |  |

Application placement location, short- to mid-term:

Higher probability/deployment ratio         Lower probability/deployment ratio         Very low probability/deployment ratio

There are five interdependent key areas that have been identified by the standards, CSPs and analysists to be the most significant methods of defining and deploying an edge computing solution.

Compute capabilities and users aren't the only things that need to be brought together for the full potential of edge to be realized. Building a strong ecosystem today is key for success in the future.

Edge computing is still in an early phase, and an industry standard is not yet agreed on that covers all aspects. But standardization and industry harmonization will be vital to avoid fragmentation in standards, technology and interfaces.

Stakeholders across the telecom industry need to work closely together to form ecosystem partnerships around potential use cases. They also need to actively engage in industry initiatives to align on edge computing, APIs and exposure - and help protect competition,  openness and innovation.

Strategic deployment planning involves evaluating the type of use case selected, deployment set-up, partner-specific considerations, and other strategic considerations. Key ecosystem partners include communication service providers, hyperscale cloud providers, network vendors, system integrators, operational technology providers, application developers, device manufacturers, and enterprises.

Read on to learn more.

## What is edge computing?

Edge computing  is a topology and location-sensitive distributed computing paradigm that puts computation sources like enterprise applications closer to where mission-critical data resides — such as cloud servers or on-premises data centers. By placing data and compute resources closer to your devices, computing from edge devices enables users across your business to access and process data faster; this, in turn, enables emerging use cases such as:

- Low-latency applications
- Faster delivery of novel content
- Lightning fast time-to-insight for both your business and your customers

The term “edge” refers to the proximity of computation sources to data sources. It’s important to note that edge computing isn't a specific technology but rather a broader architectural approach that changes many of the monolithic norms of traditional cloud computing.

Compared with traditional and data center-based apps, edge computing benefits from greatly improved processing and response times and saves bandwidth — both are vital for handling the unprecedented volumes of data prevalent in today’s digital society.

Edge computing can reduce and even eliminate data center construction and infrastructure management costs, and is more energy-efficient than traditional data centers — further reducing costs and helping organizations more effectively comply with energy regulations while optimizing performance and latency.

## What is 5G?

5G is the fifth-generation wireless cellular network standard that can connect your devices — particularly mobile devices like smartphones — to a telephone network and the wider internet. This technology began to be deployed worldwide in 2019, and is the successor to 4G technology that provides connectivity to most current mobile phones. Service areas for cellular 5G networks are divided into small geographical areas called cells.

The benefits of 5G networks that make them distinct from cellular network standard predecessors like 4G include:

- Higher download speeds , with a peak speed of 20 gigabits per second (Gbps) when only one user exists in the network
- Higher bandwidth  for delivering faster download and upload speeds than 4G
- The ability to connect more devices  to improve internet service quality in crowded areas

5G cellular networks are becoming vital to edge computing and are therefore shaping the future of enterprise IT. 5G connects wireless devices to the internet more quickly than fourth-generation LTE, offering much higher bandwidth, higher download speeds, and lower latency than what has traditionally been possible.

Mobile networks are divided into cell areas — hence the name “cellular” — and they share a design infrastructure with edge computing. As such,  5G and edge computing  can work together to offer enterprise IT companies faster edge computing and transmission of processed data to user devices across distributed networks,which can further enhance processing speeds and deliver faster, more performant applications and experiences at scale.

Read on to learn more about the intersection of  edge computing and 5G  networks and how these technologies will drive the enterprise IT world.

## Enterprise trends in edge computing and 5G

As more people embrace digital connectivity, enterprise IT companies have the opportunity to offer their services to larger audiences. Of course, these prospects will demand consistently cutting-edge experiences delivered to them fast — making low latency and high performance top-of-mind considerations for the enterprise IT world when developing future applications.

Computing at the edge of the network via 5G offers enterprise IT companies the unprecedented capability to enrich new and existing applications with optimized data processing and delivery to users. This is made possible by the rapid transition from the more traditional paradigm of smaller, more expensive data centers to a wide-scale, global deployment of computation-ready data sources like servers and production-ready 5G content delivery networks.

By using both of these emerging data infrastructures, enterprise IT service providers are better prepared to competitively meet the needs of a more connected user base.

## How businesses can leverage edge computing and 5G

Edge computing delivered via 5G networks enables companies to offer more users high-quality, next-generation application products and services. Once edge computing is deployed, businesses can make informed decisions more quickly with the insights derived from up-to-the-minute data on everything from user sentiment about their products and services to new and emerging industry trends.

Here’s just a glimpse of what a  5G and edge computing  ecosystem can make possible for enterprise IT companies:

- Lower latency application-server interactions
- Near real-time performance
- Greater bandwidth
- Faster, wider adoption and advancement of new technologies
- Building with open-source technologies that deliver the latest innovations while maintaining enterprise standards

## Industry use cases of edge computing and 5G

Many other industries worldwide have also identified key use cases for employing a hybrid 5G–edge computing approach to data processing and delivery, including:

- Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)
- Manufacturing
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Healthcare

### Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)

When AR and VR devices exhibit any degree of latency, many users experience deep discomfort — which can cause them to swear them off these technologies entirely. Edge computing delivered over 5G enables ultra-low latency experiences for AR and VR applications to encourage stronger AR/VR adoption.

### Manufacturing

Automation is necessary for manufacturing and fulfilling goods at a global scale. The computing power afforded by 5G-powered edge computing can automate quality control for products manufactured in warehouses and on production lines and provide high-precision product logistics and tracking data to any device.

### Internet of Things (IoT)

IoT-enabled devices are great for capturing and transmitting data on any number of objects, hardware, or software — but that data is only meaningful when consistently current. Edge computing for data processing and 5G networks for data transmission enable richer communications of real-time data across more stable, reliable networks.

### Healthcare

Organizations within the  healthcare  industry in particular could benefit from using a hybrid 5G–edge computing approach. From connected wearables to sensors and ambulance technology,  edge computing and 5G  can help deliver faster, cheaper, and more innovative healthcare services to more people.

## What is multi-access edge computing (MEC)?

Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a form of edge computing that enriches the IT service environment by decentralizing data centers to the 5G network edge with cloud computing capabilities. This results in data and applications distributed across multiple sources that can each be more quickly accessed by end users close to these sources. As such, MEC adoption will become integral for enterprise IT companies that are looking to stay competitive while offering their application products and services to the most users.

- Improved processing : Web-based applications perform much better when they run closer to the locations that store them.
- Latency reduction : MEC puts data caches closer to more customers, thereby minimizing the latency inherent to data transmission transactions.
- Minimal data gravity : By stratifying datasets and computation sources, you reduce the data gravity; that is, the risk of attracting smaller datasets, services, and applications into the wrong data locations. This decreases the size of datasets, making them faster and easier to relocate in the future.

## Private 5G networks

Private 5G networks are nonpublic data transmission networks for telecommunications — including equipment, cloud computing devices, and storage solutions — that are wholly owned and operated by an organization. Since these are private networks, organizations can control who uses them and can ensure optimal latency, bandwidth, and wireless connectivity when they need it.

Enterprise IT businesses use private 5G network infrastructures to ensure optimal internal digital operations, from employee-owned  mobile devices  to organizational efficiency. In doing so, they get more time and budget to invest in business drivers like products and services.

## Emerging MEC and private 5G network trends

MEC and private 5G networks trends and use cases that are driving enterprise IT businesses into a more successful  future  include:

- Artificial intelligence (AI)
- Cloud migration
- Automation

### Artificial intelligence (AI)

The use of  artificial intelligence (AI)  is expected to increase as more decision-makers employ this rapidly developing technology to quickly capture and derive insights from data, optimize their operations, provide faster, higher-quality customer experiences with more informed service, and more.

In particular, AI-driven chatbots like ChatGPT can rapidly answer questions posed by customers and organizational decision-makers alike. MEC can be used to distribute AI learning and decision-making models throughout private 5G neural networks of edge computing platform sources.

### Cloud migration

Cloud migration  of legacy data centers offers enterprise IT businesses greater access to customer and proprietary data that they can process and consult to make decisions. MEC distributes data to more physical locations throughout the world, and the data can then be transmitted to organizations via private 5G networks.

### Automation

Automation of certain tasks is becoming more prevalent in many industries — from manufacturing to automotive and finances. These automation efforts help cut costs and allow workforces to reinvest time and energy into their organization’s key value drivers. Businesses can automate everything from network management (to reduce human errors and downtime) to operational analysis (to improve performance, optimize infrastructural configuration applications, and increase scalability).

## Potential challenges and drawbacks of edge computing and 5G

Although 5G and edge computing offer enterprise IT and telecom companies many rich benefits, there are currently obstacles preventing effective adoption and use of this technology. Each is being actively addressed. However, until then, you can educate yourself about these challenges associated with a 5G and edge computing digital transformation:

- Security : The likelihood of data breaches increases when data gets stored in numerous locations instead of one centralized location, since the former option makes monitoring multiple data storage solutions more difficult. It’s also easier to bypass the often lower-quality security credentials found on local devices.
- Governance : It’s difficult to ensure that your data gathering, storage, processing, and disposal standards get properly enforced across numerous edge computing data centers at once.
- Complexity : As the amount of data to process and store continually increases, so too will the complexity of managing it all. This is particularly true of edge computing, which distributes data storage and processing across multiple locations.
