# lbt-honeybee

A collection of Honeybee core Python libraries and Honeybee extensions.

extension packages together.

## Installation

```console
pip install lbt-honeybee -U
```

## Included Honeybee Extensions

Running `pip install lbt-honeybee -U` will result in the installation of the following
honeybee Python packages:

* [honeybee-display](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-display)
* [honeybee-radiance-postprocess](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-radiance-postprocess)
