A simple (and cheesy-sounding) sound-synthesis library for playing with
some basic sounds. To play audio directly you'll need either `pyglet`
(recommended) or `simpleaudio` installed, but as a fallback you can save
`.wav` files and open them with another program to play them. Sound will
also work in a Jupyter notebook without any dependencies.

This module defines constants named C0 though B9 which hold the frequency
values of notes in scientific pitch notation, and it also defines
constants P0 through P14 which hold three octaves worth of notes from a
pentatonic scale where the middle octave starts with P5 == C4.

The system remembers the current track, time-point, instrument, pitch,
and volume, and notes are added given a specific duration using those
values. However, it's not like playing an instrument, where time is
continuous and irreversible: it's possible to change the current
time-point to write multiple notes that overlap each other.

A current key is tracked, and you can change the fundamental note and
select from a few different scale types including major, minor, and
pentatonic scales.
