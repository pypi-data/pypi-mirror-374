# B2AI Prep

A simple Python package to prepare acoustic data for the Bridge2AI voice project.

**Caution:** this package is under active development and interfaces may change rapidly.

## Installation

MacOS with Mx (ARM) chip only: Make sure that you have the ARM version of python installed.
Run this to check:
```
[path/to/your/python] -c "import platform; print(platform.machine())
```

Requires a Python >= 3.10, <3.12 environment

```
pip install b2aiprep
```

## Usage
See commands available through the CLI:

```bash
b2aiprep-cli --help
```

1. Convert an audio file to features:

    The simplest form takes an audio file, a subject id, and a task name.

    ```bash
    b2aiprep-cli convert test_audio.wav s1 mpt
    ```

    It will save a pytorch `.pt` file with a dictionary of features. This can be
    loaded by `torch.load()`. The file is named following a simple convention:
    `sub-<subject_id>_task-<task_name>_md5-<checksum>_features.pt`

    To enable speech to text transcription, specify the `--speech2text` flag.

2. Batch process audio files

    This requires a CSV file, where there is a column header called `filename` and then each subsequent line is of the form:
    path/to/audio.wav

    This also supports a CSV file where each line is of the form:
    path/to/audio.wav,subject_id,task_name

    To generate this csv file from the Production directory pulled from wasabi, use command 3.

    ```bash
    b2aiprep-cli batchconvert filelist.csv --plugin cf n_procs=2 --outdir out --save_figures
    ```

    The above command uses pydra under the hood to parallel process the audio files.
    All outputs are currently stored in a single directory specified by the `--outdir`
    flag.

    One can also generate a hugging face dataset in the output directory by specifying the
     `--dataset` flag.

    To enable speech to text transcription, specify the `--speech2text` flag.

3. Generate csv file to feed to batchconvert

    ```bash
    b2aiprep-cli createbatchcsv input_dir outfile
    ```

    The input directory should point to the location of the `Production` directory pulled from Wasabi e.g. `/Users/b2ai/production`.

    This directory can have subfolders for each institution, (e.g. `production/MIT`),
    and each subdirectory is expected to have all the `.wav` files from each institution.

    Outfile is the path to and name of the csv file to be generated, e.g. `audiofiles.csv`

   The csv file will have a header named `filename` with all the filenames listed under.

5. Verify if two audio files are from the same speaker

    ```bash
    b2aiprep-cli test_audio1.wav test_audio2.wav --model 'speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb'
    ```

    This will use the speechbrain speaker recognition model to verify that the two
    audio files are from the same speaker.

    There is a notebook in the docs directory that can be used to interact with the library
    programmatically.

6. Convert the speaker in the source audio file (1st argument) into the speaker of the target audio file (2nd argument)
     and save the result in the output file (3rd argument)

    ```bash
    b2aiprep-cli convert-voice data/vc_source.wav data/vc_target.wav data/vc_output.wav
    ```

7. Transcribe the audio

    ```bash
    b2aiprep-cli transcribe data/vc_source.wav
    ```

    Or use a different model. Note that the large model may take some time to download.

    ```bash
    b2aiprep-cli transcribe data/vc_source.wav --model_id 'openai/whisper-large-v3' --return_timestamps true
    ```

## BIDS-like data

This package provides conversion from a RedCap/file-based custom structure into a [BIDS-like](https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/folders_and_files/folders.html) structure for downstream analysis. In addition, utilities are provided for working with the BIDS-like structured data and to support data analysis of voice and questionnaire data.

Convert a RedCap CSV and a folder of audio files into the BIDS format:

```sh
b2aiprep-cli redcap2bids bridge2ai_voice_data.csv --outdir output --audiodir audio
```

The `audiodir` option above can be omitted, in which case no audio data is reorganized.

See the [tutorial.ipynb](docs/tutorial.ipynb) for a few use examples of data in the BIDS-like format.

## Summer School Data Preparation
This command organizes the data with the BIDS-like conversion tool, extracts audio features, and saves the whole thing
as a .tar file for easy distribution for the Bridge2AI Summer School:

```sh
b2aiprep-cli prepsummerdata \
   [path to RedCap CSV] \
   [path to Wasabi export directory] \
   [desired path to BIDS output] \
   [desired output path for .tar file]
```

## Streamlit dashboard

A dashboard is provided to help navigate the data in the BIDS format. Launch the dashboard from the repository folder with:

```sh
streamlit run src/b2aiprep/app/Dashboard.py [path to BIDS directory]
```
After the Streamlit dashboard opens, please wait for the BIDS data to be loaded while on the Dashboard page, as an error regarding a non-initialized `bids_dir` directory may pop up if the BIDS data has not been fully loaded.
