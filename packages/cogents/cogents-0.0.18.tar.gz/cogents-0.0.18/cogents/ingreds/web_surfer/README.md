I like the design philosophy behind Stagehand, which gives developers a balance between a delicate control and labor-free agentic view among different web-browsing tasks. However, it is a pity that Stagehand is cloud serviced while browser-use addresses more about high-level agentic senarios. So I decomposed browser-use well-design components into cogents resources.
