# PyWiner

A powerful Python library for interacting with the Windows operating system. PyWiner provides two main functionalities:
1. **System Automation:** Control processes, run batch commands, and more.
2. **GUI Framework:** Create native Windows applications with a simple class-based approach.

## Installation

Since PyWiner is currently under development, you can install it directly from your local project directory.

First, navigate to the root directory of your project (where `setup.py` is located) in your terminal. Then, run the following command:

```bash
pip install .
