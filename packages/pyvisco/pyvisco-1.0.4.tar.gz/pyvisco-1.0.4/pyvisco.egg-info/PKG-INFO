Pyvisco is a Python library that supports the identification of Prony series
parameters for linear viscoelastic materials described by a Generalized Maxwell
model. The necessary material model parameters are identified by fitting a Prony
series to the experimental measurement data in either the frequency-domain
(via Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis) or time-domain (via relaxation
measurements). Pyvisco performs the necessary data processing of the
experimental measurements, mathematical operations, and curve-fitting routines
to identify the Prony series parameters. These parameters are used in subsequent
Finite Element simulations involving linear viscoelastic material models that
accurately describe the mechanical behavior of polymeric materials such as
encapsulants and backsheets of PV modules. An optional minimization routine is
included to reduce the number of Prony elements. This routine is helpful in
large Finite Element simulations where reducing the computational complexity of
the linear viscoelastic material models can shorten the simulation time.
