This extension provides `filter-tabs` and `tab` directives to create user-friendly, switchable content blocks, ideal for showing code examples in multiple languages or instructions for different platforms.

## Features

- **No JavaScript:** Pure CSS implementation ensures maximum compatibility, speed, and accessibility.
- **WAI-ARIA Compliant:** The generated HTML follows accessibility best practices for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- **Highly Customizable:** Easily theme colors, fonts, and sizes directly from your `conf.py` using CSS Custom Properties.
- **Graceful Fallback:** Renders content as simple admonitions in non-HTML outputs like PDF/LaTeX.
- **Automated Testing:** CI/CD pipeline tests against multiple Sphinx versions to ensure compatibility.

You can install this extension using `pip`:
```bash
pip install sphinx-filter-tabs
