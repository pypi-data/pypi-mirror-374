<img src="https://github.com/AmirAnsarpour/Finely/raw/main/finely/assets/icon/icon-tra.png" width="100">

Listen up, you primitive money-grubbing meatbags! **Finely** is the most _insanely_ badass desktop app for wrestling your pathetic Earth credits into submission. Built with Flet and Python, it’s got a _sick dark mode_ and a UI so slick it’ll make your brain short-circuit. Your data? **Now safely stored in your OS’s sacred user directory** — no more fragile `data.json` floating next to the code. Clouds? Pfft, we don’t trust that garbage. Take control of your cash or get schwifty trying.
