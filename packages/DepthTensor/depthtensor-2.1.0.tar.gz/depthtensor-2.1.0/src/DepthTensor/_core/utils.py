    Reverses broadcasting to the un-broadcasted shape.

    When a variable was broadcasted in order to be compatible with the other, e.g. [1.0] + [1.0, 2.0, 3.0], differentiating
    the result w.r.t. the broadcasted variable such that the gradient matches the variable's gradient requires collapsing
    the result's shape down to the variable's.

    Let's say:
    Scalar A, vector B (1x3)

    C = A + B (A is broadcasted into a 1x3 vector)

    In order to calculate A's gradients, per the chain rule, we have to differentiate C w.r.t. A, which gives you a vector
    with the same shape as C's, even though the gradient's shape must match A's.

    Mathematically, since A influences every components of C, to get the gradient, we would have to sum every connections from
    A to C, which this function generalizes for every cases.
