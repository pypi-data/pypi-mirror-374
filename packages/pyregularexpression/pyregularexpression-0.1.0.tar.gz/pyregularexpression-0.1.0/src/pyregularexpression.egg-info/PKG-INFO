              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# pyRegularExpression

This package provides a collection of regular expression-based functions to identify and extract components of the scientific process from text. These components include things like identifying if a text discusses adherence, compliance, eligibility criteria, and more.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyregularexpression
```

## Usage

### Finder Functions

Each `*_finder.py` module contains finder functions that return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end character indices of a match and the matched string itself.

For example, the `adherence_compliance_finder.py` module contains functions to find mentions of treatment adherence or compliance. The functions are named `find_adherence_compliance_v1` through `find_adherence_compliance_v5`, where `v1` is a high-recall version and `v5` is a high-precision version.

Here's an example of how to use one of these functions:

```python
from pyregularexpression.adherence_compliance_finder import find_adherence_compliance_v1

text = "The study measured adherence to the new drug. Adherence was defined as PDC > 0.8."

matches = find_adherence_compliance_v1(text)

for start, end, snippet in matches:
    print(f"Found '{snippet}' at indices {start}-{end}")
```

### Example: Finding Medical Codes

Here is an example of how to use the `medical_code_finder` to extract potential medical codes from a piece of text.

```python
from pyregularexpression.medical_code_finder import find_medical_code_v1

text = "The patient was diagnosed with ICD-10 code I21.0, which is an acute myocardial infarction. The CPT code was 99285."

matches = find_medical_code_v1(text)

for start, end, snippet in matches:
    print(f"Found medical code: {snippet}")

```

### Helper Functions

The package also includes helper functions to apply multiple finder functions at once.

#### `apply_regex_funcs`

This function applies a list of finder functions to a text and returns a dictionary of the results.

```python
from pyregularexpression.apply_regex_functions import apply_regex_funcs
from pyregularexpression.adherence_compliance_finder import find_adherence_compliance_v1
from pyregularexpression.algorithm_validation_finder import find_algorithm_validation_v1

text = "The study measured adherence to the new drug. The algorithm was validated."

results = apply_regex_funcs(text, [find_adherence_compliance_v1, find_algorithm_validation_v1])

print(results)
```

#### `extract_regex_paragraphs_udf`

This function returns a Spark UDF that can be used to extract paragraphs from a text that match any of a list of finder functions.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyregularexpression.extract_regex_paragraphs_udf import extract_regex_paragraphs_udf
from pyregularexpression.adherence_compliance_finder import find_adherence_compliance_v1
from pyregularexpression.algorithm_validation_finder import find_algorithm_validation_v1

spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

data = [("The study measured adherence to the new drug.\n\nThe algorithm was validated.",)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["text"])

udf = extract_regex_paragraphs_udf([find_adherence_compliance_v1, find_algorithm_validation_v1])

df.withColumn("matched_paragraphs", udf(df["text"])).show()
```
