## Introduction

This is a ManimGL / ManimCE plugin (**still under construction**) for the automated animation of algebra. It consists of a few key components: 
- Expression: These objects contain a tree structure representing algebra expressions/equations, such as `3x^2`, `5+9`, and `sin(y)=14e^x`, as well as a method for producing a corresponding Tex/MathTex mobject.
- Action: These objects contain methods to convert between expressions/equations, such as adding something to both sides, or substituting a variable for a value. This conversion can be static or animated.
- Timeline: These objects contain an alternating sequence of expressions and actions, and methods for automatically determining these sequences, and managing mobject adding/removing and action animations.
