"""Balparda's TransCrypto Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) library.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard>

<https://cryptography.io/en/latest/>

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael
is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the
U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.

We don't want to re-implement AES here, we will provide for good crypto
wrappers, consistent with the transcrypto style.

    This is, purposefully, a very costly operation that should be cheap to execute once

    We do not use salt (or, more precisely, we use a fixed salt), as this is meant for direct use,
    not to store the key in a DB. To compensate, the number o iterations is set especially high:
    on the computer this was developed it takes ~1 sec to execute and is almost triple the
    recommended amount of 600,000 (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2).

    The salt and the iteration number were randomly generated when this method was written
    so as to be unique to this implementation and not a standard one that can have a standard
    dictionary (i.e. attacks would have to generate a dictionary specific to this implementation).
    ON THE OTHER HAND, this only serves the purpose of generating keys from static passwords.
    NEVER use this method to save a database of keys. ONLY use it for direct user input.
