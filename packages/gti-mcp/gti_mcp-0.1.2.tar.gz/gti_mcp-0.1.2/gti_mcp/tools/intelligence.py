  You can search by for different IOC types using the `entity` modifier. Below, the different IOC types and the supported orders:

    | Entity type   | Supported orders | Default order |
    | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
    | file          | first_submission_date, last_submission_date, positives, times_submitted, size	    | last_submission_date- |

  Note: The `entity` modifier can only be used ONCE per query.

  You can find all available modifers at:
    - Files: https://gtidocs.virustotal.com/docs/file-search-modifiers

    - Domains: https://gtidocs.virustotal.com/docs/domain-search-modifiers
    - IP Addresses: https://gtidocs.virustotal.com/docs/ip-address-search-modifiers

  With integer modifers, use the `-` and `+` characters to indicate:
    - Greater than: `p:60+`
    - Less than: `p:60-`
    - Equal to: `p:60`
