<!-- Insert catchy summary -->

VirtualShipParcels is a command line simulator allowing students to plan and conduct a virtual research expedition, receiving measurements as if they were coming from actual oceanographic instruments including:

- ADCP (currents)
- CTD (conductivity and temperature)
- XBT (temperature)
- underwater measurements (salinity and temperature)
- surface drifters
- argo float deployments

<!-- TODO: future. Along the way students will encounter difficulties such as: -->

## Installation

For a normal installation do:

```bash
conda create -n ship -c conda-forge virtualship
conda activate ship
```

which creates an environment named `ship` with the latest version of `virtualship`. You can replace `ship` with any name you like.

For a development installation, please follow the instructions detailed in the [contributing page](https://virtualship.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/index.html).
