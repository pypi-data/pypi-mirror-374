# Project Name Ideas for Hook Manager

## Nautical/Pirate Theme (Playing off "Hook")
- **Grapple** - Clean, action-oriented, implies hooking/grabbing
- **Eyelet** - Naval term for ship's ropes and hooks
- **Bosun** (Boatswain) - Ship officer who manages eyelet
- **Anchor** - Hooks and holds
- **Tether** - Connection/binding theme

## Fishing Theme
- **Angler** - One who uses hooks professionally
- **Tackle** - Fishing gear including hooks
- **Lure** - Attracts and hooks
- **Snag** - Quick, catchy, implies catching/hooking

## Technical/Development Theme
- **Intercept** - Clear about what it does
- **Mesh** - Network of interconnections
- **Nexus** - Connection point
- **Conduit** - Channel for flow
- **Relay** - Pass messages along

## Action/Tool Theme
- **Grapnel** - Multi-hooked tool
- **Snare** - Capture mechanism

## Clever Wordplay
- **Hookwright** - Like playwright, someone who crafts hooks
- **Rigger** - Sets up complex hook systems

## Final Thoughts
I lean toward **Grapple** or **Eyelet** - they're professional, memorable, and the maritime theme fits perfectly with "hooks" without being too cute. Both would look great on a README and are easy to say in conversation: "Just install grapple to manage your hooks" or "Set up eyelet for your workflow automation."
