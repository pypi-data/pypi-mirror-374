# Eyelet Project Status

## 🎯 Project Overview
Building **Eyelet** - a hook orchestration system for AI agents with comprehensive management, templating, and execution handling for Claude Code hooks.

## ✅ Completed Components

### Architecture & Planning
- ✓ PRD with Python/uvx implementation 
- ✓ Technology decisions documented (Python 3.11+, Textual, Click)
- ✓ Vertical slice architecture implemented
- ✓ Project naming and branding (Naval/Hornblower theme)
- ✓ Hook discovery system design
- ✓ Hook combination matrix (28 primary combinations)

### Core Infrastructure
- ✓ Python project initialized with uv
- ✓ Domain models (Hook, Template, Workflow, etc.)
- ✓ Repository pattern (abstract + in-memory implementation)
- ✓ Service layer (HookService, ConfigurationService, etc.)
- ✓ Basic CLI structure with Click

### Universal Hook Handler ⭐ NEW!
- ✓ Eyelet (Hook Management System) logging to `./eyelet-hooks/`
- ✓ Comprehensive JSON logging of ALL hook data
- ✓ Logical directory structure by hook type, tool, and date
- ✓ `configure install-all` command for one-click setup
- ✓ Non-invasive (always returns success)
- ✓ Captures environment, context, and full payloads

### CLI Features
- ✓ Comprehensive help system with Rich formatting
- ✓ Shell completion support (bash, zsh, fish, powershell)
- ✓ Error handling with helpful guidance
- ✓ Command structure:
  - `configure` - Hook management commands
    - `install-all` - Install universal logging for ALL hooks
  - `template` - Template operations
  - `execute` - Hook execution endpoint
  - `logs` - Execution log viewing
  - `discover` - Hook/tool discovery
  - `completion` - Shell completion management

## 🚧 In Progress / High Priority

### Critical Missing Features
1. **Hook Execution Logic** - The `execute` command needs to actually process hooks
2. **Claude Code SDK Integration** - Need to integrate the Python SDK
3. **SQLite Database Layer** - Currently using placeholders
4. **Workflow Engine** - Core workflow execution is not implemented
5. **Template System** - Need to create and install actual templates
6. **Dynamic Autocomplete** - Enhanced completion with discovered values

## 📋 Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement actual hook execution logic
- [ ] Create workflow engine for complex hook behaviors  
- [ ] Implement SQLite database with SQLAlchemy
- [ ] Build template system with default templates
- [ ] Add Claude Code SDK integration
- [ ] Package for uvx distribution
- [ ] Enhance autocomplete with dynamic discovery

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Design hook workflow abstraction architecture
- [ ] Define SQLite schema for hook execution logging
- [ ] Create TUI interface with Textual
- [ ] Plan integration with Claude settings.json
- [ ] Implement hook discovery from docs/runtime
- [ ] Test CLI error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Write user documentation

## 🎯 Next Steps Priority

1. **Make it Work** - Focus on core functionality:
   - Hook execution that actually processes Claude Code hooks
   - SQLite logging that persists executions
   - Basic workflow support
   - Claude SDK integration

2. **Make it Useful** - Add key features:
   - Default templates (bash-validator, observability)
   - Dynamic autocomplete that discovers values
   - TUI for visual management
   - Real workflow engine

3. **Make it Distributable**:
   - Package for uvx
   - Comprehensive tests
   - Documentation
   - Examples

## 💡 Key Requirements to Remember

From the PRD:
- **Dynamic Hook Discovery** - Must adapt as Claude Code evolves
- **Comprehensive Logging** - Every execution tracked in SQLite
- **Template System** - Pre-configured patterns for common use cases
- **Workflow Engine** - Chain complex behaviors
- **AI Integration** - Use Claude SDK for intelligent workflows
- **Naval Theme** - Consistent terminology throughout

From user requirements:
- **Autocomplete Everything** - Even options users don't know about
- **Never Give Up** - Retreat only with human approval
- **Documentation Updates** - Keep all docs current with changes
- **uvx Distribution** - Team needs latest version instantly

## 🎯 Definition of Done

For Eyelet to be considered functional:
1. Can configure hooks and save to .claude/settings.json
2. Can execute as a hook endpoint and log to SQLite
3. Can install and use templates
4. Can view execution logs
5. Has working shell completion
6. Can be installed via `uvx eyelet`
