# GitHub Actions Setup Complete! 🚀

The GitHub Actions workflows have been created locally and are ready to be deployed. Due to OAuth limitations, you'll need to add them manually to GitHub.

## ✅ What's Been Created

I've set up 4 comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows:

### 1. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to main, PRs to main
- **Features**:
  - Multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
  - Python 3.11 & 3.12 support
  - Linting and formatting with ruff
  - Type checking with mypy
  - Test coverage with pytest
  - Package building and installation testing

### 2. PyPI Publishing (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`)
- **Triggers**: When a GitHub release is published
- **Features**:
  - Builds package with uv
  - Validates with twine check
  - Automatically publishes to PyPI using `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret

### 3. Release Automation (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Version tags (v0.1.3, v1.0.0, etc.)
- **Features**:
  - Runs full test suite
  - Extracts release notes from CHANGELOG.md
  - Creates GitHub release with installation instructions
  - Attaches wheel and source distribution files

### 4. Post-Publish Validation (`.github/workflows/validate-published.yml`)
- **Triggers**: After GitHub release is published
- **Features**:
  - Tests installation from PyPI on multiple platforms
  - Validates both pipx and uvx installation methods
  - Tests basic functionality and settings validation

## 🔧 Manual Setup Required

Since the OAuth app lacks workflow permissions, you need to:

### 1. Add Workflows to GitHub
```bash
# The workflows are ready in .github/workflows/
# You can either:
# A) Push without workflows first, then add via GitHub UI
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Undo last commit
git reset HEAD .github/  # Unstage workflows
git commit -m "Update documentation and package name to eyelet"
git push origin main

# Then add workflows via GitHub web interface
```

### 2. Set Up PyPI Secret
1. Go to your GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add new repository secret:
   - **Name**: `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: Your PyPI token (stored in keychain)

To get the token:
```bash
security find-generic-password -a brahn -s pypi-api-token -w
```

### 3. Test the Workflow
1. Create a version tag to test release automation:
```bash
git tag v0.1.3
git push origin v0.1.3
```

2. Or create a GitHub release manually to test PyPI publishing

## 🎯 Automated Workflow

Once set up, the complete automation flow will be:

1. **Development** → Push code to main
2. **CI runs** → Tests, lints, builds on all platforms
3. **Version tag** → `git tag v0.1.4 && git push origin v0.1.4`
4. **Release workflow** → Creates GitHub release automatically
5. **Publish workflow** → Publishes to PyPI automatically
6. **Validation** → Tests the published package works

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Add workflows to GitHub** (manually via web interface)
2. **Add PYPI_API_TOKEN secret**
3. **Test with a version tag**
4. **Update repository name** to `eyelet` when ready

The automation is ready to go! Every release will now automatically:
- ✅ Run full test suite
- ✅ Create GitHub release with notes
- ✅ Publish to PyPI
- ✅ Validate the published package works

🎉 **No more manual PyPI uploads needed!** Just create version tags and everything happens automatically.
