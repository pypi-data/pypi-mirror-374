Multi-Environment Deployment Strategy Management.

This module provides a comprehensive framework for managing multi-environment
deployment strategies in Python applications. It enables developers to define
custom environment enumerations and automatically detect the current runtime
environment based on various runtime contexts and environment variables.

- 🔧 **devops**: Foundation environment for building code, conducting unit tests,
    and creating artifacts. Not used for application deployment.
- 🧰 **sbx101, 102, 103**: Sandbox environments for temporary development/testing,
    allowing multiple engineers to work on different branches concurrently without
    interference. Named with convention 'sbx-${number}' for easy provisioning/destruction.
- 💻 **dev**: Development environment for active development work.
- 🧪 **tst**: Durable test environment for integration and end-to-end testing,
    including high-risk tests like load/stress testing that could compromise
    system integrity.
- 🎸 **stg**: Staging environment mirroring production conditions for QA testing
    under realistic workloads. Outputs captured for analysis, not visible to end users.
- 👮 **qa**: Isolated environment allowing external QA collaborators to work on
    testing without affecting other environments or having access to sensitive systems.
- 🚦 **preprd**: Pre-production environment with production data but isolated from
    end user traffic, enabling high-risk changes and debugging with real data.
- 🏭 **prd**: Production environment serving end-users directly, with immutable
    artifact versioning for quick rollbacks.

    Base class for defining custom environment name enumerations.

    This class provides the foundation for creating project-specific environment
    enumerations while enforcing validation rules and providing utility methods.
    All custom environment enumerations must inherit from this class and follow
    the established patterns.

    **Required Environments:**

    Every custom enumeration must define at least three environments:

    1. **devops**: Build and CI/CD environment (not for deployment)
    2. **dev**: Development environment for active coding and testing
    3. **prd**: Production environment for live user traffic

    1. Validation of environment names.
    2. Iteration over all available environment names.

    To define your own environment name enumerations class, you need to subclass
    this class. However, there are some restrictions:

    1. You cannot create a "devops" environment as it does not qualify as a workload environment.
    1. You must include at least a "devops", a "dev" (development) environment
        and a "prd" (production) environment.
    2. environment name has to be lower case, without

    **Validation Rules:**

    - Environment names must be lowercase with digits only (a-z, 0-9)
    - First character must be a letter (a-z)
    - No special characters, spaces, or uppercase letters
    - Must include required environments (devops, dev, prd)

    **Usage Pattern:**

    1. Inherit from BaseEnvNameEnum
    2. Define environment constants
    3. Call validate() to ensure compliance
    4. Use with detect_current_env() for runtime detection

    Intelligently detect the current environment name based on runtime context.

    This function implements a sophisticated environment detection strategy that
    adapts to different runtime contexts (local development, CI/CD, production apps)
    and provides sensible defaults while allowing explicit overrides.

    **Detection Strategy:**

    The detection logic follows a priority-based approach designed to handle
    common deployment patterns while maintaining flexibility:

    1. **Local Development Runtime** (laptop, workstation):
        - **Default**: 'dev' environment (assumption: developers usually work in dev)
        - **Override**: USER_ENV_NAME environment variable allows switching contexts
        - **Use Case**: Developer testing different environment configurations locally
    2. **CI/CD Runtime** (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.):
        - **Priority 1**: USER_ENV_NAME (manual override for special cases)
        - **Priority 2**: ENV_NAME (standard CI environment specification)
        - **Use Case**: Automated deployments to different target environments
    3. **Application Runtime** (deployed applications):
        - **Priority 1**: USER_ENV_NAME (operational override capability)
        - **Priority 2**: ENV_NAME (deployment-time environment specification)
        - **Use Case**: Production applications that need environment context

    **Design Rationale:**

    **Why Two Environment Variables?**

    - ``ENV_NAME``: **System-level** environment specification set by deployment
        infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, or container orchestration. This represents
        the "official" environment designation.
    - ``USER_ENV_NAME``: **User-level** override for operational flexibility.
        Allows developers, DevOps engineers, or applications to temporarily
        override the environment context without changing infrastructure.

    **Why Default to 'dev' Locally?**

    - **Developer Experience**: Most local development work happens in dev context
    - **Safety**: Prevents accidental production operations from local machines
    - **Flexibility**: Easy override with USER_ENV_NAME when needed
