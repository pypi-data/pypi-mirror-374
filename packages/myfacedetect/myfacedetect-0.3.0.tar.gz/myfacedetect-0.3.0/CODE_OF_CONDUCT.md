# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct  

## Our Pledge  

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, are committed to making participation in our community a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free experience for everyone.  
We celebrate diversity and pledge to create an environment that is inclusive of all peopleâ€”regardless of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, gender identity or expression, education, experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, socio-economic background, or sexual orientation.  

Our goal is to foster an open, safe, and healthy community built on respect, empathy, and collaboration.  

## Our Standards  

### Positive behavior includes:  
- Showing empathy, kindness, and respect to others.  
- Valuing differing opinions, perspectives, and experiences.  
- Giving and receiving constructive feedback gracefully.  
- Taking responsibility for mistakes, apologizing, and learning from them.  
- Prioritizing the well-being and success of the community over individual interests.  

### Unacceptable behavior includes:  
- Sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances.  
- Insults, trolling, or personal/political attacks.  
- Public or private harassment of any kind.  
- Sharing othersâ€™ private information (e.g., addresses, emails) without consent.  
- Any conduct that would reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.  

## Enforcement Responsibilities  

Community leaders are responsible for defining and upholding standards of acceptable behavior. They may remove, edit, or reject contributions (comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, etc.) that violate this Code of Conduct.  
They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate, ensuring fairness and transparency.  

## Scope  

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and when individuals are representing the community in public settings.  
Representation examples include using an official community email, posting on official social accounts, or acting as a delegate at online/offline events.  

## Reporting Issues  

If you experience or witness abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please report it to the community leaders at:

All reports will be handled promptly, respectfully, and confidentially. We are committed to protecting the privacy and safety of reporters.
