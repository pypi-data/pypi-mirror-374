# PyEarthTools: Machine learning for Earth system science

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/903938118.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15760768)

- An approachable way for researchers to get started with ML research for Earth system science
- Provides a software framework for research and experimentation
- Also suitable for students and newcomers
- Still under early-stage development - things are likely to change a lot. If you notice an issue, please feel free to raise it on GitHub

## Installation

**Here is the quickest way to install the complete framework and get started:**

We strongly recommend using either a Conda or Python [virtual environment](https://pyearthtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#virtual-environments).

Run the following commands to install PyEarthTools in a Conda environment:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools.git
conda create -y -p ./venv python graphviz
conda activate ./venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd notebooks
jupyter lab
```

Alternatively, run the following commands to install PyEarthTools in a Python virtual environment:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools.git
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd notebooks
jupyter lab
```
> [!TIP]
> (Optional) Install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) (not installable via pip) to display pipelines.

PyEarthTools comprises multiple sub-packages which may be installed and used separately. See the [installation guide](https://pyearthtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for more details.

## Overview of PyEarthTools

PyEarthTools is a Python framework containing modules for:
 - loading and fetching data;
 - pre-processing, normalising and standardising data into a normal form suitable for machine learning;
 - defining machine learning (ML) models;
 - training ML models and managing experiments;
 - performing inference with ML models;
 - and evaluating ML models.

## Overview of the Packages within PyEarthTools

PyEarthTools comprises multiple sub-packages which can be used individually or together.

|    Sub-Package                 |  Purpose  |
|--------------------------------|---------------------- |
|  [Data](https://pyearthtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/data/data_index.html)    | Loading and indexing Earth system data into xarray |
|  [Utils](https://pyearthtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/utils/utils_index.html)  | Code for common functionality across the sub-packages |
|  [Pipeline](https://pyearthtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pipeline/pipeline_index.html)       |  Process and normalise Earth system data ready for machine learning |
|  [Training](https://pyearthtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/training/training_index.html)       | Training processes for machine learning models |
|  [Tutorial](https://pyearthtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tutorial/tutorial_index.html)       | Contains helper code for data sets used in tutorials |
|  [Bundled Models](https://pyearthtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/bundled_models/bundled_index.html) | Maintained versions of specific, bundled models which can be easily trained and run |
|  [Zoo](https://pyearthtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/zoo/zoo_index.html)            | Contains code for managing registered models (such as the bundled models) |
|  Evaluation     | (Coming soon) Contains code for producing standard evaluations (such as benchmarks and scorecards) |
