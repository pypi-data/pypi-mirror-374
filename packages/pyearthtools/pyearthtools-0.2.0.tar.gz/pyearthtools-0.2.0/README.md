## Installation

**Here is the quickest way to install the complete framework and get started:**

We strongly recommend using either a Conda or Python [virtual environment](https://pyearthtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#virtual-environments).

Run the following commands to install PyEarthTools in a Conda environment:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools.git
conda create -y -p ./venv python graphviz
conda activate ./venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd notebooks
jupyter lab
```

Alternatively, run the following commands to install PyEarthTools in a Python virtual environment:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:ACCESS-Community-Hub/PyEarthTools.git
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd notebooks
jupyter lab
```
> [!TIP]
> (Optional) Install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) (not installable via pip) to display pipelines.

PyEarthTools comprises multiple sub-packages which may be installed and used separately. See the [installation guide](https://pyearthtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for more details.

## Overview of PyEarthTools

PyEarthTools is a Python framework containing modules for:
 - loading and fetching data;
 - pre-processing, normalising and standardising data into a normal form suitable for machine learning;
 - defining machine learning (ML) models;
 - training ML models and managing experiments;
 - performing inference with ML models;
 - and evaluating ML models.

## Overview of the Packages within PyEarthTools

PyEarthTools comprises multiple sub-packages which can be used individually or together.
