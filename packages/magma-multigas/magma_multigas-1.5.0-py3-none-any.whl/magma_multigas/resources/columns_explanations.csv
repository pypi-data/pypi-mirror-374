Avg_CO2_lowpass,"Average molar mixing ratio by volume of carbon dioxide gas (CO2) during the sample cycle. Onboard processing with a single pole recursive lowpass filter is applied to raw CO2 data collected at 1 Hz to match the response of CO2 instrument to the electrochemical sulfur sensors. The filter takes the form: CO2_lowpass = [CO2,n*a + CO2,n-1*b] where coefficients a and b sum to equal 1 and are derived empirically from step response data from sensor calibrations."
Avg_SO2,"Average molar mixing ratio by volume of sulfur dioxide gas (SO2) during the sample cycle. A pressure correction (pcorr) and linear span and offset values applied to raw sensor values: SO2=(SO2,pcorr)*SPAN+OFFSET. The appropriate pressure correction is determined by testing."
