We introduce the Ultra Fast Image Generator (UFig) which aims to bring wide-field imaging simulations to the current limits of computational capabilities. We achieve this goal through: (1) models of galaxies, stars and observational conditions, which, while simple, capture the key features necessary for realistic simulations, and (2) state-of-the-art computational and implementation optimizations. We present the performances of UFig and show that it is faster than existing public simulation codes by several orders of magnitude. It allows us to produce images more quickly than SExtractor needs to analyze them. For instance, it can simulate a typical 0.25deg2 Subaru SuprimeCam image (10k×8k pixels) with a 5-σ limiting magnitude of R=26 in 30 s on a laptop, yielding an average simulation time for a galaxy of 30 μs. This code is complementary to end-to-end simulation codes and can be used as a fast, central component of observational methods relying on simulations. For instance, it can be used to efficiently calibrate high-precision measurements, as recently suggested for cosmic shear.}

		Abstract

		We present GalSBI, a phenomenological model of the galaxy population for cosmological applications using simulation-based inference. The model is based on analytical parametrizations of galaxy luminosity functions, morphologies and spectral energy distributions. Model constraints are derived through iterative Approximate Bayesian Computation, by comparing Hyper Suprime-Cam deep field images with simulations which include a forward model of instrumental, observational and source extraction effects. We developed an emulator trained on image simulations using a normalizing flow. We use it to accelerate the inference by predicting detection probabilities, including blending effects and photometric properties of each object, while accounting for background and PSF variations. This enables robustness tests for all elements of the forward model and the inference. The model demonstrates excellent performance when comparing photometric properties from simulations with observed imaging data for key parameters such as magnitudes, colors and sizes. The redshift distribution of simulated galaxies agrees well with high-precision photometric redshifts in the COSMOS field within 1.5σ for all magnitude cuts. Additionally, we demonstrate how GalSBI’s redshifts can be utilized for splitting galaxy catalogs into tomographic bins, highlighting its potential for current and upcoming surveys. GalSBI is fully open-source, with the accompanying Python package, galsbi ( https://cosmo-docs.phys.ethz.ch/galsbi/ ), offering an easy interface to quickly generate realistic, survey-independent galaxy catalogs.

For imaging surveys, this is usually done using photometric redshifts estimated on an object-by-object basis. We present a new approach for directly measuring the global $n(z)$ of cosmological galaxy samples, including uncertainties, using forward modeling. Our method relies on image simulations produced using UFig (Ultra Fast Image Generator) and on ABC (Approximate Bayesian Computation) within the $MCCL$ (Monte-Carlo Control Loops) framework. The galaxy population is modeled using parametric forms for the luminosity functions, spectral energy distributions, sizes and radial profiles of both blue and red galaxies. We apply exactly the same analysis to the real data and to the simulated images, which also include instrumental and observational effects. By adjusting the parameters of the simulations, we derive a set of acceptable models that are statistically consistent with the data. We then apply the same cuts to the simulations that were used to construct the target galaxy sample in the real data. The redshifts of the galaxies in the resulting simulated samples yield a set of $n(z)$ distributions for the acceptable models. We demonstrate the method by determining $n(z)$ for a cosmic shear like galaxy sample from the 4-band Subaru Suprime-Cam data in the COSMOS field. We also complement this imaging data with a spectroscopic calibration sample from the VVDS survey. We compare our resulting posterior $n(z)$ distributions to the one derived from photometric redshifts estimated using 36 photometric bands in COSMOS and find good agreement. This offers good prospects for applying our approach to current and future large imaging surveys.}

	abstractnote = {Modeling the Point Spread Function (PSF) of wide-field surveys is vital for many astrophysical applications and cosmological probes including weak gravitational lensing. The PSF smears the image of any recorded object and therefore needs to be taken into account when inferring properties of galaxies from astronomical images. In the case of cosmic shear, the PSF is one of the dominant sources of systematic errors and must be treated carefully to avoid biases in cosmological parameters. Recently, forward modeling approaches to calibrate shear measurements within the Monte-Carlo Control Loops ($MCCL$) framework have been developed. These methods typically require simulating a large amount of wide-field images, thus, the simulations need to be very fast yet have realistic properties in key features such as the PSF pattern. Hence, such forward modeling approaches require a very flexible PSF model, which is quick to evaluate and whose parameters can be estimated reliably from survey data. We present a PSF model that meets these requirements based on a fast deep-learning method to estimate its free parameters. We demonstrate our approach on publicly available SDSS data. We extract the most important features of the SDSS sample via principal component analysis. Next, we construct our model based on perturbations of a fixed base profile, ensuring that it captures these features. We then train a Convolutional Neural Network to estimate the free parameters of the model from noisy images of the PSF. This allows us to render a model image of each star, which we compare to the SDSS stars to evaluate the performance of our method. We find that our approach is able to accurately reproduce the SDSS PSF at the pixel level, which, due to the speed of both the model evaluation and the parameter estimation, offers good prospects for incorporating our method into the $MCCL$ framework.}

In this work, we propose a novel technique to forward model wide-field broad-band galaxy surveys using the fast image simulator UFig and measure the LF of galaxies in the B-band. We use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to constrain the galaxy population model parameters of the simulations and match data from CFHTLS. We define a number of distance metrics between the simulated and the survey data. By exploring the parameter space of the galaxy population model through ABC to find the set of parameters that minimize these distance metrics, we obtain constraints on the LFs of blue and red galaxies as a function of redshift. We find that $mathrm{M^*}$ fades by $Delta mathrm{M}^*_{mathrm{0.1-1.0,b}} = 0.68 pm 0.52$ and $Delta mathrm{M}^*_{mathrm{0.1-1.0,r}} = 0.54 pm 0.48$ magnitudes between redshift $mathrm{z = 1}$ and $mathrm{z = 0.1}$ for blue and red galaxies, respectively. We also find that $phi^*$ for blue galaxies stays roughly constant between redshift $mathrm{z = 0.1}$ and $mathrm{z=1}$, while for red galaxies it decreases by $sim 35%$. We compare our results to other measurements, finding good agreement at all redshifts, for both blue and red galaxies. To further test our results, we compare the redshift distributions for survey and simulated data. We use the spectroscopic redshift distribution from the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) and we apply the same selection in colours and magnitudes on our simulations. We find a good agreement between the survey and the simulated redshift distributions. We provide best-fit values and uncertainties for the parameters of the LF. This work offers excellent prospects for measuring other galaxy population properties as a function of redshift using ABC.},

The aim is to improve the constraints on the spectral coefficients used to create the galaxy spectral energy distributions (SED) of the galaxy population model in Tortorelli et al. 2020. In that work, the model parameters were inferred from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) data using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). This led to stringent constraints on the B-band galaxy luminosity function parameters, but left the spectral coefficients only broadly constrained. To address that, we perform an ABC inference using CFHTLS and PAUS data. This is the first time our approach combining forward-modelling and ABC is applied simultaneously to multiple datasets. We test the results of the ABC inference by comparing the narrow-band magnitudes of the observed and simulated galaxies using Principal Component Analysis, finding a very good agreement. Furthermore, we prove the scientific potential of the constrained galaxy population model to provide realistic stellar population properties by measuring them with the SED fitting code textsc{CIGALE}. We use CFHTLS broad-band and PAUS narrow-band photometry for a flux-limited ($mathrm{i}<22.5$) sample of galaxies up to redshift $mathrm{z sim 0.8}$. We find that properties like stellar masses, star-formation rates, mass-weighted stellar ages and metallicities are in agreement within errors between observations and simulations.

(2017) to determine the redshift distribution of cosmological galaxy samples and, in the process, the authors derived a model for the galaxy population mainly based on broad-band photometry. Here, we test this model by forward modeling the 40 narrow-band photometry given by the novel PAU Survey (PAUS). For this purpose, we apply the same forced photometric pipeline on data and simulations using Source Extractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). The image simulation scheme performance is assessed at the image and at the catalogues level. We find good agreement for the distribution of pixel values, the magnitudes, in the magnitude-size relation and the interband correlations. A principal component analysis is then performed, in order to derive a global comparison of the narrow-band photometry between the data and the simulations. We use a `mixing’ matrix to quantify the agreement between the observed and simulated sets of Principal Components (PCs). We find good agreement, especially for the first three most significant PCs. We also compare the coefficients of the PCs decomposition. While there are slight differences for some coefficients, we find that the distributions are in good agreement. Together, our results show that the galaxy population model derived from broad-band photometry is in good overall agreement with the PAUS data. This offers good prospect for incorporating spectral information to the galaxy model by adjusting it to the PAUS narrow-band data using forward modeling.}

This cosmic shear technique relies on the accurate measurement of the shapes and redshifts of background galaxies and requires precise control of systematic errors. The Monte Carlo Control Loops (MCCL) is a forward modelling method designed to tackle this problem. It relies on the Ultra Fast Image Generator (UFig) to produce simulated images tuned to match the target data statistically, followed by calibrations and tolerance loops. We present the first end-to-end application of this method, on the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 wide field imaging data. We simultaneously measure the shear power spectrum $C_{ell}$ and the redshift distribution $n(z)$ of the background galaxy sample. The method includes maps of the systematic sources, Point Spread Function (PSF), an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) inference of the simulation model parameters, a shear calibration scheme, and the fast estimation of the covariance matrix. We find a close statistical agreement between the simulations and the DES Y1 data using an array of diagnostics. In a non-tomographic setting, we derive a set of $C_ell$ and $n(z)$ curves that encode the cosmic shear measurement, as well as the systematic uncertainty. Following a blinding scheme, we measure the combination of $Omega_m$, $sigma_8$, and intrinsic alignment amplitude $A_{rm{IA}}$, defined as $S_8D_{rm{IA}} = sigma_8(Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}D_{rm{IA}}$, where $D_{rm{IA}}=1-0.11(A_{rm{IA}}-1)$. We find $S_8D_{rm{IA}}=0.895^{+0.054}_{-0.039}$, where systematics are at the level of roughly 60% of the statistical errors. We discuss these results in the context of earlier cosmic shear analyses of the DES Y1 data. Our findings indicate that this method and its fast runtime offer good prospects for cosmic shear measurements with future wide-field surveys.},

We use a model that captures the redshift evolution of the galaxy luminosity functions, colours, and morphology, for red and blue samples. We constrain this model via simulation-based inference, using factorized Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) at the image level. We apply this framework to HSC deep field images, complemented with photometric redshifts from COSMOS2020. The simulated telescope images include realistic observational and instrumental effects. By applying the same processing and selection to real data and simulations, we obtain a sample of n(z) distributions from the ABC posterior. The photometric properties of the simulated galaxies are in good agreement with those from the real data, including magnitude, colour and redshift joint distributions. We compare the posterior n(z) from our simulations to the COSMOS2020 redshift distributions obtained via template fitting photometric data spanning the wavelength range from UV to IR. We mitigate sample variance in COSMOS by applying a reweighting technique. We thus obtain a good agreement between the simulated and observed redshift distributions, with a difference in the mean at the 1$sigma$ level up to a magnitude of 24 in the i band. We discuss how our forward model can be applied to current and future surveys and be further extended.

SciPy has become a de facto standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in the Python programming language, with more than 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories, and millions of downloads per year. This includes usage of SciPy in almost half of all machine learning projects on GitHub, and usage by high profile projects including LIGO gravitational wave analysis and creation of the first-ever image of a black hole (M87). The library includes functionality spanning clustering, Fourier transforms, integration, interpolation, file I/O, linear algebra, image processing, orthogonal distance regression, minimization algorithms, signal processing, sparse matrix handling, computational geometry, and statistics. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices of the SciPy library and highlight some recent technical developments.}

This marks an order of magnitude step change in the level of scrutiny employed in weak lensing shape measurement analysis. We provide descriptions of each method tested and include 10 evaluation metrics over 24 simulation branches. GREAT10 was the first shape measurement challenge to include variable fields; both the shear field and the Point Spread Function (PSF) vary across the images in a realistic manner. The variable fields enable a variety of metrics that are inaccessible to constant shear simulations including a direct measure of the impact of shape measurement inaccuracies, and the impact of PSF size and ellipticity, on the shear power spectrum. To assess the impact of shape measurement bias for cosmic shear we present a general pseudo-Cl formalism, that propagates spatially varying systematics in cosmic shear through to power spectrum estimates. We also show how one-point estimators of bias can be extracted from variable shear simulations. The GREAT10 Galaxy Challenge received 95 submissions and saw a factor of 3 improvement in the accuracy achieved by shape measurement methods. The best methods achieve sub-percent average biases. We find a strong dependence in accuracy as a function of signal-to-noise, and indications of a weak dependence on galaxy type and size. Some requirements for the most ambitious cosmic shear experiments are met above a signal-to-noise ratio of 20. These results have the caveat that the simulated PSF was a ground-based PSF. Our results are a snapshot of the accuracy of current shape measurement methods and are a benchmark upon which improvement can continue. This provides a foundation for a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of shape measurement methods.}

GREAT3 was divided into experiments to test three speciﬁc questions, and included simulated space- and ground-based data with constant or cosmologically varying shear ﬁelds. The simplest (control) experiment included parametric galaxies with a realistic distribution of signal-to-noise, size, and ellipticity, and a complex point spread function (PSF). The other experiments tested the additional impact of realistic galaxy morphology, multiple exposure imaging, and the uncertainty about a spatially varying PSF; the last two questions will be explored in Paper II. The 24 participating teams competed to estimate lensing shears to within systematic error tolerances for upcoming Stage-IV dark energy surveys, making 1525 submissions overall. GREAT3 saw considerable variety and innovation in the types of methods applied. Several teams now meet or exceed the targets in many of the tests conducted (to within the statistical errors). We conclude that the presence of realistic galaxy morphology in simulations changes shear calibration biases by ∼1 per cent for a wide range of methods. Other effects such as truncation biases due to ﬁnite galaxy postage stamps, and the impact of galaxy type as measured by the Se´rsic index, are quantiﬁed for the ﬁrst time. Our results generalize previous studies regarding sensitivities to galaxy size and signal-to-noise, and to PSF properties such as seeing and defocus. Almost all methods’ results support the simple model in which additive shear biases depend linearly on PSF ellipticity.},

	abstractnote = {Weak lensing by large-scale structure is a powerful technique to probe the dark components of the universe. To understand the measurement process of weak lensing and the associated systematic effects, image simulations are becoming increasingly important. For this purpose we present a first implementation of the $textit{Monte Carlo Control Loops}$ ($textit{MCCL}$; Refregier & Amara 2014), a coherent framework for studying systematic effects in weak lensing. It allows us to model and calibrate the shear measurement process using image simulations from the Ultra Fast Image Generator (UFig; Berge et al. 2013). We apply this framework to a subset of the data taken during the Science Verification period (SV) of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We calibrate the UFig simulations to be statistically consistent with DES images. We then perform tolerance analyses by perturbing the simulation parameters and study their impact on the shear measurement at the one-point level. This allows us to determine the relative importance of different input parameters to the simulations. For spatially constant systematic errors and six simulation parameters, the calibration of the simulation reaches the weak lensing precision needed for the DES SV survey area. Furthermore, we find a sensitivity of the shear measurement to the intrinsic ellipticity distribution, and an interplay between the magnitude-size and the pixel value diagnostics in constraining the noise model. This work is the first application of the $textit{MCCL}$ framework to data and shows how it can be used to methodically study the impact of systematics on the cosmic shear measurement.}

We investigate the impact of redshift errors and their interplay with different IA models. Generally, errors on the mean $delta_z$ and on the width $sigma_z$ of the redshift bins can both lead to biases in cosmological constraints. We find that such biases can, however, only be partially resolved by marginalizing over $delta_z$ and $sigma_z$. For Stage-III surveys, $delta_z$ and $sigma_z$ cannot be well constrained due to limited statistics. The resulting biases are thus sensitive to prior volume effects. For Stage-IV surveys, we observe that marginalizing over the redshift parameters has an impact and reduces the bias. We derive requirements on the uncertainty of $sigma_z$ and $delta_z$ for both Stage-III and Stage-IV surveys. We assume that the redshift systematic errors on $S_8$ should be less than half of the statistical errors, and the median bias should be smaller than $0.25sigma$. We find that the uncertainty on $delta_z$ has to be $lesssim0.025$ for the NLA IA model with a Stage-III survey. For $sigma_z$, the requirement is met even for large uncertainties $leq0.3$. For the TATT IA model, the uncertainty on $delta_z$ has to be $lesssim0.02$ and the uncertainty on $sigma_z$ has to be $lesssim0.2$. For Stage-IV surveys, the uncertainty on $delta_z$ has to be $lesssim0.005$ and the uncertainty on $sigma_z$ should be $lesssim0.1$, with no significant dependence on the IA model. This required high precision will be a challenge for the redshift calibration of these future surveys. Finally, we investigate whether the interplay between redshift systematics and IA modelling can explain the $S_8$-tension between cosmic shear results and CMB measurements. We find that this is unlikely to explain the current $S_8$-tension.}

	abstractnote = {In classical cosmological analysis of large-scale structure surveys with two-point functions, the parameter measurement precision is limited by several key degeneracies within the cosmology and astrophysics sectors. For cosmic shear, clustering amplitude σ8 and matter density Ωm roughly follow the S8=σ8(Ωm/0.3 )0.5 relation. In turn, S8 is highly correlated with the intrinsic galaxy alignment amplitude AIA. For galaxy clustering, the bias bg is degenerate with both σ8 and Ωm, as well as the stochasticity rg. Moreover, the redshift evolution of intrinsic alignment (IA) and bias can cause further parameter confusion. A tomographic two-point probe combination can partially lift these degeneracies. In this work we demonstrate that a deep-learning analysis of combined probes of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering, which we call DeepLSS, can effectively break these degeneracies and yield significantly more precise constraints on σ8, Ωm, AIA, bg, rg, and IA redshift evolution parameter ηIA. In a simulated forecast for a stage-III survey, we find that the most significant gains are in the IA sector: the precision of AIA is increased by approximately 8 times and is almost perfectly decorrelated from S8. Galaxy bias bg is improved by 1.5 times, stochasticity rg by 3 times, and the redshift evolution ηIA and ηb by 1.6 times. Breaking these degeneracies leads to a significant gain in constraining power for σ8 and Ωm, with the figure of merit improved by 15 times. We give an intuitive explanation for the origin of this information gain using sensitivity maps. These results indicate that the fully numerical, map-based forward-modeling approach to cosmological inference with machine learning may play an important role in upcoming large-scale structure surveys. We discuss perspectives and challenges in its practical deployment for a full survey analysis.}

		We present a forward-modeling simulation framework designed to model the data
		products from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). This forward-model process can be
		thought of as a transfer function—a mapping from cosmological/astronomical
		signals to the final data products used by the scientists. Using output from
		the cosmological simulations (the Blind Cosmology Challenge), we generate
		simulated images (the Ultra Fast Image Simulator) and catalogs representative
		of the DES data. In this work we demonstrate the framework by simulating the
		244 deg2 coadd images and catalogs in five bands for the DES Science
		Verification data. The simulation output is compared with the corresponding
		data to show that major characteristics of the images and catalogs can be
		captured. We also point out several directions of future improvements. Two
		practical examples—star-galaxy classification and proximity effects on object
		detection—are then used to illustrate how one can use the simulations to
		address systematics issues in data analysis. With clear understanding of the
		simplifications in our model, we show that one can use the simulations
		side-by-side with data products to interpret the measurements. This forward
		modeling approach is generally applicable for other upcoming and future
		surveys. It provides a powerful tool for systematics studies that is
		sufficiently realistic and highly controllable.

DES is using a wide-field camera (DECam) on the 4 m Blanco Telescope in Chile to image 5000 sq deg of the sky in five filters (grizY). By its completion, the survey is expected to have generated a catalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million stars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to yield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The main goals of DES are to characterize dark energy and dark matter, and to test alternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large-scale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia supernovae. However, DES also provides a rich data set which allows us to study many other aspects of astrophysics. In this paper, we focus on additional science with DES, emphasizing areas where the survey makes a difference with respect to other current surveys. The paper illustrates, using early data (from `Science Verification’, and from the first, second and third seasons of observations), what DES can tell us about the Solar system, the Milky Way, galaxy evolution, quasars and other topics. In addition, we show that if the cosmological model is assumed to be Λ+cold dark matter, then important astrophysics can be deduced from the primary DES probes. Highlights from DES early data include the discovery of 34 trans-Neptunian objects, 17 dwarf satellites of the Milky Way, one published z > 6 quasar (and more confirmed) and two published superluminous supernovae (and more confirmed).}

The survey includes three layers: the Wide layer will cover 1400 deg2 in five broad bands (grizy), with a 5 σ point-source depth of r ≈ 26. The Deep layer covers a total of 26 deg2 in four fields, going roughly a magnitude fainter, while the UltraDeep layer goes almost a magnitude fainter still in two pointings of HSC (a total of 3.5 deg2). Here we describe the instrument, the science goals of the survey, and the survey strategy and data processing.

	abstractnote = {Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) provide a “standard ruler” of known physical length, making it one of the most promising probes of the nature of dark energy (DE). The detection of BAOs as an excess of power in the galaxy distribution at a certain scale requires measuring galaxy positions and redshifts. “Transversal” (or “angular”) BAOs measure the angular size of this scale projected in the sky and provide information about the angular distance. “Line-of-sight” (or “radial”) BAOs require very precise redshifts, but provide a direct measurement of the Hubble parameter at different redshifts, a more sensitive probe of DE. The main goal of this paper is to show that it is possible to obtain photometric redshifts with enough precision (σz) to measure BAOs along the line of sight. There is a fundamental limitation as to how much one can improve the BAO measurement by reducing σz. We show that σz ∼ 0.003(1 + z) is sufficient: a much better precision will produce an oversampling of the BAO peak without a significant improvement on its detection, while a much worse precision will result in the effective loss of the radial information. This precision in redshift can be achieved for bright, red galaxies, featuring a prominent 4000 Å break, by using a filter system comprising about 40 filters, each with a width close to 100 Å, covering the wavelength range from ∼4000 to ∼8000 Å, supplemented by two broad-band filters similar to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey u and z bands. We describe the practical implementation of this idea, a new galaxy survey project, PAU16, to be carried out with a telescope/camera combination with an etendue about 20 m2 deg2, equivalent to a 2 m telescope equipped with a 6 deg2 field of view camera, and covering 8000 deg2 in the sky in four years. We expect to measure positions and redshifts for over 14 million red, early-type galaxies with L > L⋆ and iAB ≲ 22.5 in the redshift interval 0.1 < z < 0.9, with a precision σz < 0.003(1 + z). This population has a number density n ≳ 10−3 Mpc−3 h3 galaxies within the 9 Gpc3 h−3 volume to be sampled by our survey, ensuring that the error in the determination of the BAO scale is not limited by shot noise. By itself, such a survey will deliver precisions of order 5% in the dark-energy equation of state parameter w, if assumed constant, and can determine its time derivative when combined with future cosmic microwave background measurements. In addition, PAU will yield high-quality redshift and low-resolution spectroscopy for hundreds of millions of other galaxies, including a very significant high-redshift population. The data set produced by this survey will have a unique legacy value, allowing a wide range of astrophysical studies.},

In this paper, we present a detailed photo-z performance study using photometric simulations for 40 equally spaced 12.5-nm-wide (full width at half-maximum) filters with an ∼25 per cent overlap and spanning the wavelength range from 450 to 850 nm, together with a ugrizY broad-band filter system. We then present the migration matrix rij, containing the probability that a galaxy in a true redshift bin j is measured in a photo-z bin i, and study its effect on the determination of galaxy auto- and cross-correlations. Finally, we also study the impact on the photo-z performance of small variations of the filter set in terms of width, wavelength coverage, etc., and find a broad region where slightly modified filter sets provide similar results, with the original set being close to optimal.}
