abstract: >-
   With the rise of simulation-based inference (SBI) methods, simulations need
   to be fast as well as realistic. 𝚄𝙵𝚒𝚐 𝚟𝟷 is a public Python package that
   generates simulated astronomical images with exceptional speed - taking
   approximately the same time as source extraction. This makes it particularly
   well-suited for simulation-based inference (SBI) methods where computational
   efficiency is crucial. To render an image, 𝚄𝙵𝚒𝚐 requires a galaxy catalog
   and a description of the point spread function (PSF). It can also add
   background noise, sample stars using the Besançon model of the Milky Way,
   and run 𝚂𝙴𝚡𝚝𝚛𝚊𝚌𝚝𝚘𝚛 to extract sources from the rendered image. The extracted
   sources can be matched to the intrinsic catalog, flagged based on 𝚂𝙴𝚡𝚝𝚛𝚊𝚌𝚝𝚘𝚛
   output and survey masks, and emulators can be used to bypass the image
   simulation and extraction steps. A first version of 𝚄𝙵𝚒𝚐 was presented in
   Bergé et al. (2013) and the software has since been used and further
   developed in a variety of forward modelling applications.
