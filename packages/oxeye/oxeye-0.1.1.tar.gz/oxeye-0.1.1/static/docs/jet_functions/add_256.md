# `jet::add_256(a, b)` - 256-bit Addition

**Parameters:**
- `a: u256` - First operand
- `b: u256` - Second operand

**Returns:** `u256` - Sum of a and b

Performs addition on two 256-bit unsigned integers.

## Usage
```simplicity
let total: u256 = jet::add_256(amount1, amount2);
let incremented: u256 = jet::add_256(value, 1);
```

**Note:** Arithmetic operations in Simplicity are checked for overflow to ensure contract safety.
