## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Yahoo Developer App credentials (setup will guide you)

### üöÄ Easy Installation (PyPI)

**One-Command Install:**
```bash
# Install and run directly with uvx (recommended)
uvx league-analysis-mcp-server

# Or install with pip
pip install league-analysis-mcp-server
league-analysis-mcp-server

# Or run with python
python -m league_analysis_mcp_server
```

**First-time setup:**
After installation, the server will guide you through Yahoo API setup automatically.

### üîß Development Installation

**From Source:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd league-analysis-mcp
uv run python setup_complete.py
```

This automated script will:
- ‚úÖ Install all dependencies  
- ‚úÖ Run comprehensive system tests
- ‚úÖ Guide you through Yahoo OAuth setup
- ‚úÖ Test the complete integration
- ‚úÖ Provide usage instructions

## üöÄ **NEW! Streamlined Authentication Setup**

**No more complex setup scripts!** Authentication is now handled entirely through conversational MCP tools:

### **5-Step Setup Process:**

1. **Install & Connect** - Add server to your MCP client
2. **Check Status** - AI assistant runs `check_setup_status()` 
3. **Create Yahoo App** - AI assistant shows you exactly what to do with `create_yahoo_app()`
4. **Save Credentials** - AI assistant saves them for you with `save_yahoo_credentials(key, secret)`
5. **Complete OAuth** - AI assistant guides you through `start_oauth_flow()` and `complete_oauth_flow(code)`

**That's it!** ‚ú® Everything happens in your conversation with the AI assistant. No file editing, no command line scripts, no leaving the interface.

### **Example User Experience:**

```
You: "Show me my fantasy league standings"

AI: Let me check that for you. First, I need to check your authentication setup.
    ‚Üí Runs check_setup_status()
    
AI: I see you need to create a Yahoo Developer app first. Here are the exact steps:
    ‚Üí Runs create_yahoo_app()
    ‚Üí Shows step-by-step instructions with exact values to use

You: "I created the app! My key is dj0yJmk9... and secret is abc123..."

AI: Perfect! Let me save those credentials for you.
    ‚Üí Runs save_yahoo_credentials(key, secret)
    ‚Üí Automatically saves to your environment

AI: Great! Now let's complete the OAuth authorization. Please visit this URL:
    ‚Üí Runs start_oauth_flow()
    ‚Üí Shows authorization URL and clear instructions

You: "I authorized it and got code: xyz789"

AI: Excellent! Let me complete the setup.
    ‚Üí Runs complete_oauth_flow("xyz789")
    
AI: üéâ Setup complete! Now let me get your league standings...
    ‚Üí Runs get_standings() and shows your data
```

**Total time: ~2 minutes.** No technical knowledge required!

### üîß **Fallback: Manual Setup (Advanced Users)**

If you prefer the traditional approach, you can still use the manual setup scripts. But most users will love the new conversational setup!

## Usage

### Starting the Server
```bash
# PyPI Installation (recommended):
uvx league-analysis-mcp-server

# Or if installed with pip:
league-analysis-mcp-server

# Development/Source:
uv run python -m src.server
```

## üîå MCP Client Configuration

    "league-analysis": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["league-analysis-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "league-analysis": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["league-analysis-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Continue.dev

Add this to your Continue config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "league-analysis",
      "command": ["uvx", "league-analysis-mcp-server"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Other MCP Clients

For any MCP-compatible client, use these connection details:
- **Command:** `uvx`
- **Args:** `["league-analysis-mcp-server"]`
- **Transport:** stdio (default)
- **No working directory needed!**

### üîß Testing Your Connection

After adding to your MCP client:

1. **Restart your MCP client** (Claude Desktop, etc.)
2. **Test the connection** by asking:
   - "Can you get server info for the league analysis server?"
   - "List available seasons for NFL"
   - "What fantasy sports tools are available?"
3. **Check server status** with: `get_server_info()`

### üö® Troubleshooting MCP Connection

**Common issues:**

1. **Server not found:**
   - Check the file path in your config
   - Ensure UV is installed and in PATH
   - Verify the server starts manually: `uv run python -m src.server`

2. **Authentication errors:**
   - Use the new streamlined setup: Ask your AI assistant to run `check_setup_status()`
   - For advanced users: Run `uv run python utils/setup_yahoo_auth.py`
   - Check your Yahoo Developer app settings

3. **Permission issues:**
   - Ensure your MCP client has permission to execute UV
   - Check working directory permissions

4. **Environment variables:**
   - MCP clients may not inherit your shell environment
   - Create `.env` file in project root with credentials

   - Check app configuration in Yahoo Developer Console
   - Run `get_setup_instructions()` for detailed setup help

2. **No Historical Data**
   - Ensure league has existed for multiple seasons
   - Verify correct league ID and sport combination
   - Check game ID mappings in config/game_ids.json

3. **Cache Issues**
   - Use `clear_cache("all")` to reset all cached data
