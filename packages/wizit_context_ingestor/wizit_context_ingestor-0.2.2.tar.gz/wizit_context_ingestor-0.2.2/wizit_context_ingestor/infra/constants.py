# Transcribe the exact text from the provided Document, regardless of length, ensuring extreme accuracy. Organize the transcript using markdown.

# Follow these steps:

# 1. Examine the provided page carefully. It is essential to capture every piece of text exactly as it appears on each page, maintaining the original language,formatting and structure as closely as possible.
# 2. Identify all elements present in the page, including headings, body text, footnotes, tables, images, captions, page numbers, paragraphs, lists, indents, and any text within images, with special attention to retain bold, italicized, or underlined formatting, etc.
# 3. Use markdown syntax to format your output:
#     - Headings: # for main, ## for sections, ### for subsections, etc.
#     - Lists: * or - for bulleted, 1. 2. 3. for numbered

# 4. If the element is an image (not table)
#     - If the information in the image can be represented by a table, generate the table containing the information of the image, otherwise provide a detailed description about the information in the image
#     - Classify the element as one of: Chart, Diagram, Natural Image, Screenshot, Other. Enclose the class in <figure_type></figure_type>
#     - Enclose <figure_type></figure_type>, the table or description, and the figure title or caption (if available), in <figure></figure> tags
#     - Do not transcribe text in the image after providing the table or description
#     - Do not include encoded image content.
#     - Do not transcribe logos, icons or watermarks.

# 5. If the element is a table
#     - Create a markdown table, ensuring every row has the same number of columns
#     - Maintain cell alignment as closely as possible
#     - Do not split a table into multiple tables
#     - If a merged cell spans multiple rows or columns, place the text in the top-left cell and output ' ' for other
#     - Use | for column separators, |-|-| for header row separators
#     - If a cell has multiple items, list them in separate rows
#     - If the table contains sub-headers, separate the sub-headers from the headers in another row

# RULES:
# 1. Transcribe all text exactly as it appears, including:
#    - Paragraphs
#    - Headers and footers
#    - Footnotes and page numbers
#    - Text in bullet points and lists
#    - Captions under images
#    - Text within diagrams
# 2. Never modify or summarize the text, just transcribe it.
# 3. Mark unclear or illegible text as [unclear] or [illegible], providing a best guess where possible.
# 5. All generated content (transcription, context fields, descriptions) must be in the original document language.
# 6. Complete the entire document transcription - avoid partial transcriptions.
# 7. Never generate information by yourself, only transcribe the text exactly as it appears.
# 8. Never include blank lines in the transcription.
# 10. Do not include logos or icons in your transcriptions
