## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for AWS S3

This repository provides an implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for AWS S3, enabling AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to securely interact with S3 buckets. The server offers a standardized interface to list S3 buckets, list objects within buckets, and download file contents. It facilitates seamless integration between AI applications and AWS S3 storage for efficient data retrieval and management.

### Key Features
- **List S3 Buckets**: Retrieve a list of available buckets in an AWS account.
- **List Objects**: Display objects within a specified bucket.
- **File Download**: Fetch the contents of specific objects, such as documents or other files.
- **Secure Interaction**: Provides a standardized, secure interface for AI models to interact with S3.
- **MCP Ecosystem**: Part of the Model Context Protocol ecosystem, supporting AI model integration with various data sources.

### Use Cases
- **Data Analysis**: Access and analyze data stored in S3 buckets for AI-driven applications.
- **Document Retrieval**: Retrieve specific files (e.g., PDFs) for processing by AI models.
- **Automation**: Automate S3 bucket management tasks via natural language queries with LLMs.
- **AI Development**: Support development of AI models requiring access to external data sources.

### Prerequisites
To use this server, developers need:
- Configured AWS credentials (Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and Region).
- Depending on the implementation, specific runtime environments (e.g., Node.js 18 or higher for some versions).
- Familiarity with the [Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) for AI application integration.

### Limitations
Some implementations may:
- Support only specific file types (e.g., PDFs in certain versions).
- Have limits on the number of retrieved objects (e.g., up to 1000 objects).
- Require specific configurations, such as the maximum number of buckets to return.

### Installation and Usage
Exact installation depends on the implementation. For a typical Node.js-based version:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone -https://github.com/ENGRZULQARNAIN/mcp_server_s3_download_files.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure AWS credentials and server settings (e.g., via environment variables or a config file).
4. Start the server: `npm start`
5. Integrate with an AI model or application using the MCP interface.

Refer to the repository's documentation for detailed setup instructions and API usage.
