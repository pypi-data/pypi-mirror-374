```

## Libigl functions

Currently the following functionalities of Libigl are included in the wrapper

* Geodesic distance calculation
* Scalarfield isolines
* Quad mesh planarization
* Mass matrix of triangle meshes
* Discrete gaussian curvature
* Ray/mesh intersection
* Boundary loops
* Harmonic parametrisation
* Least-squares conformal maps

## Examples
