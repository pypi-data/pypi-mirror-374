		Required
		----------------
		X: n-by-p data matrix (n = number of samples, p = number of features)

		qpath_max: maximum allowed sum of q-values along paths

		Optional
		----------------
		max_radius: maximum radius of the estimated local graph
		fdr_local: neighborhood FDR threshold at each radius (list of length max_radius)
		custom_nbhd: dictionary of custom neighborhood FDR thresholds for user-specified features
		feature_names: names of the features, used if custom_nbhd is provided
		criterion:
		selector: base method for computing q-values
		ipss_args: additional arguments passed to the IPSS function
		verbose: whether to print progress during selection
