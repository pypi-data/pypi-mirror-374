# punpy: Propagating Uncertainties with PYthon

**punpy** is a Python software package to propagate random, structured and systematic uncertainties through a given measurement function.

punpy is part of the [CoMet Toolkit](https://www.comet-toolkit.org) (community metrology toolkit), and can combined with the [obsarray](https://obsarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Measurement uncertainty handling in Python) for efficient definition, storing and interfacing with uncertainty information using standardised metadata.

## Installation

punpy is installable via pip.
```
pip install punpy
```
