Thanks for exploring LangChain Education. We offer 
a few different ways to learn – including courses,   YouTube videos, and documentation – and I’d love 
to give you a quick overview to help you find the   format that works for you. LangChain Academy 
offers three types of courses: Foundational,   Project, and Quickstart. Foundational courses 
cover topics very methodically, taking you   from introduction to mastery. These are longer 
courses and will take some time to complete.   Project courses guide you through building a 
specific project – such as a Deep Research agent   – step-by-step. Along the way, you’ll also gain 
skills in using LangGraph, LangSmith, and more.   These are typically completed in a few hours. 
Quickstart courses offer a quick introduction or   review of a topic. They are not exhaustive, but 
can provide some necessary information quickly.   We also publish a wide range of educational videos 
on our YouTube channel. These cover current topics   or product features, along with in-depth series 
– like how to run evaluations or use LangSmith   effectively. It’s a great resource worth 
exploring. Of course, LangChain has extensive   documentation that we’ve been working hard on. 
It includes plenty of examples and step-by-step   instructions to help you get started and go 
deeper. I look forward to seeing what you build.
