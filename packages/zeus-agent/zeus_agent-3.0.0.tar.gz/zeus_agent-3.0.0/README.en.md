## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📋 System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8+
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Memory**: 4GB+ (8GB+ recommended)
- **Storage**: 2GB+ available space

### 🛠️ Installation and Deployment

```bash
# 1. Clone project (including submodules)
git clone --recursive https://gitee.com/fpga1988/zeus.git
cd zeus

# 2. Activate Python virtual environment
source activate_venv.sh  # Linux/macOS
# or activate_venv.bat  # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure environment variables
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # If using DeepSeek

# 5. Run examples
python examples/complete_agent_demo.py
```

### 🎯 Core Examples

#### 1. Create Simple Agent

```python
from layers.cognitive.cognitive_agent import CognitiveAgent
from layers.adapter.deepseek.adapter import DeepSeekAdapter

# Create cognitive agent
agent = CognitiveAgent(
    name="MyAgent",
    adapter=DeepSeekAdapter()
)

# Initialize and process requests
await agent.initialize()
response = await agent.process("Please help me analyze this problem...")
print(response.content)
```

#### 2. Team Collaboration

```python
from layers.business.teams.team_engine import TeamEngine

# Create team
team = TeamEngine("Development Team")
team.add_member("Architect", skills=["System Design", "Technology Selection"])
team.add_member("Developer", skills=["Code Implementation", "Unit Testing"])

# Assign tasks
result = await team.execute_task("Develop a user management system")
```

#### 3. Workflow Orchestration

```python
from layers.business.workflows.workflow_engine import WorkflowEngine

# Define workflow
workflow = WorkflowEngine()
workflow.add_step("Requirement Analysis", agent=business_analyst)
workflow.add_step("Technical Design", agent=architect, depends_on=["Requirement Analysis"])
workflow.add_step("Code Implementation", agent=developer, depends_on=["Technical Design"])

# Execute workflow
result = await workflow.execute("Develop new feature")
```
