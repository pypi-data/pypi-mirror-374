## Key Features

### **Automated Simulations**
Run multiple conversation simulations with different personas to test your AI agent's behavior across various scenarios.

```python
await janus.run_simulations(
    num_simulations=10,
    max_turns=5,
    target_agent=lambda: MyAgent().chat,
    api_key="your_janus_api_key"
)
```

### **Function Call Tracing**
Automatically trace function calls with the `@track` decorator or manually trace external tools and APIs.

```python
from janus_sdk import track, start_tool_event, finish_tool_event

@track
def analyze_data(data: dict) -> dict:
    return analysis_result

# Manual tracing for external tools
handle = start_tool_event("database_query", "SELECT * FROM users")
result = query_database()
finish_tool_event(handle, result)
```

### **Rule-Based Evaluation**
Define custom rules to evaluate your agent's responses and detect issues like hallucinations or policy violations. Specify rules directly in the SDK or more robustly and specifically in the Janus webapp.

```python
rules = [
    "The agent should never provide medical advice",
    "The agent should cite sources when making claims",
    "The agent should stay within the conversation context"
]
```

### **Framework Integration**
Works seamlessly with popular frameworks like LangChain through custom callbacks.

```python
from janus_sdk import JanusLangChainCallback

agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent,
    tools=[weather_tool],
    callbacks=[JanusLangChainCallback()]
)
```

## Use Cases

Janus Python SDK is designed to help you test and evaluate AI applications across various domains:

### **Customer Support & Service**
Test customer service agents (chat, voice, or workflow-based) to ensure they provide accurate, helpful responses while maintaining brand voice and compliance standards.

### **Healthcare & Medical**
Validate medical AI applications for accuracy, safety, and compliance with healthcare regulations. Test responses to medical queries, medication information, and treatment recommendations across any interaction format.

### **Finance & Banking**
Ensure financial AI advisors and agents follow strict compliance rules, provide accurate financial information, and maintain security protocols regardless of how users interact with them.

### **Education & Training**
Test educational AI tutors and learning assistants for accuracy, appropriate content levels, and educational effectiveness across different subjects, age groups, and interaction methods.

### **E-commerce & Retail**
Validate product recommendation engines, shopping assistants, and customer service agents for accuracy, helpfulness, and conversion optimization through any user interface.

### **Legal & Compliance**
Test legal AI assistants for accuracy, compliance with legal standards, and appropriate disclaimers and limitations across all interaction channels.

<Info>
**Tip:** Janus helps you define domain-specific rules and test scenarios that match your industry requirements and compliance needs.
