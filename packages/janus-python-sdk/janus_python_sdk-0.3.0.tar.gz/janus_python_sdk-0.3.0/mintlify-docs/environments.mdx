The Janus team builds out many custom integrations and environments for clients whose use cases are broader and require more specialized environments than what's available in the standard SDK.

## What We Build

Our custom solutions include:

- **Specialized Testing Environments**: Custom test frameworks for specific industries (healthcare, finance, legal, etc.)
- **Enterprise Integrations**: Connectors to enterprise systems, databases, and APIs
- **Curated Domain-Specific Datasets**: Using Janus synthetic data engine
