## Get Started in 5 Minutes

Learn how to test your first AI agent with Janus Python SDK. This guide will walk you through creating a simple agent and running automated simulations.



## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

<Check>
- Python 3.9 or higher installed
- A Janus API key (contact [team@withjanus.com](mailto:team@withjanus.com))

</Check>

## Step 1: Install the SDK

Install Janus Python SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install janus-python-sdk
```

<Check>
Verify the installation by importing the SDK in Python:
```python
import janus_sdk
print("Janus SDK installed successfully!")
```
</Check>

## Step 2: Set Up Your Environment

Create a `.env` file in your project directory to store your API key:

```bash
# .env
JANUS_API_KEY=your_janus_api_key_here
# You can use any model - we're using OpenAI API for this example
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

<Warning>
Never commit your API keys to version control. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Create Your First Agent

Create a simple AI agent that responds to user prompts. Wrap helper functions with `@track` for automatic tracing:

```python
# my_agent.py
import asyncio
import os
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from janus_sdk import run_simulations, track

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

@track                          # ① traces this helper (inputs • output • timing)
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

class MyAgent:                    # ② exactly one async chat method
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = AsyncOpenAI(
            api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        )
        self.system_prompt = "You are a helpful AI assistant. Keep your responses concise and accurate."

    async def chat(self, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str:
        """Main chat method that will be tested by Janus."""
        prompt += f"  (2+3={add(2,3)})"     # use the tracked helper
        response = await self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": self.system_prompt},
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ],
            max_tokens=100,
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content

async def main():
    # Run simulations with your agent
    results = await run_simulations(
        num_simulations=3,  # Start with a small number for testing
        max_turns=3,        # Keep conversations short for quick testing
        target_agent=lambda: MyAgent().chat,
        api_key=os.getenv("JANUS_API_KEY"),
    )
    
    print(f"Completed {len(results)} simulations!")
    for i, result in enumerate(results):
        print(f"Simulation {i+1}: {result.get('status', 'unknown')}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

<Info>
**Tip:** Anything wrapped with `@track` is automatically logged (inputs, outputs, timing) in every simulation turn.
</Info>

## Step 4: Configure Your Testing Environment (Webapp)

Before running simulations, you need to set up your testing environment in the Janus webapp:

### Create Test Cases
1. Go to the **Test & Rules → Test Cases** page to create and manage your test queries
2. Add specific queries you want to test against, along with context and goals for each test case
3. These will be used in your simulations

### Define Rule Sets
1. Go to the **Test & Rules → Rule Sets** tab to create and manage rules
2. Define compliance rules, response quality checks, and behavioral constraints that you want to test your agent's responses against

### Create Simulation Templates
1. Go to the **Chat page** and create custom configurations for your agents
2. You can only use one template at a time
3. Star a template when you're ready to test against it

<Info>
**Tip:** The SDK and webapp work hand-in-hand. Use the webapp to configure simulations and the SDK to run them programmatically.

## Step 5: Run Your First Test

Execute your agent test:

```bash
python my_agent.py
```



## Step 6: Understand the Results

Janus will provide detailed results for each simulation, including:

- **Conversation logs** - Full conversation history
- **Performance metrics** - Response times, token usage
- **Evaluation scores** - Rule-based assessments
- **Error detection** - Hallucinations, policy violations
- **Tool usage patterns** - Detailed tracing of `@track` functions and manual traces
- **Performance bottlenecks** - Slow operations and error analysis
