This module allows you to configure partners that will be automatically
in copy of their company's business documents.

For example, you can configure an accountant to be in copy of all
invoices sent for a given commercial partner, regardless of the
invoicing address.

Configuration
=============

Go to Configuration > Technical > Automation > Autosubscribe Models and
configure the models for which you want the feature to work.

Then, on each partner, you can check the company documents subscriptions
in the field In copy of.

This feature can be disabled on specific templates, if required, by
disabling the Autosubscribe followers field.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Consider implementing domain-based autosubscription rules. This was
  considered during first development but it wasn't a requirement at the
  time. If pursuit, this has to be done carefully to avoid affecting
  performance.
