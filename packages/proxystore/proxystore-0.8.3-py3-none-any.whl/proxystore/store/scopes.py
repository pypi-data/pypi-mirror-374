    """Shim around function executor for managing reference proxy scopes.

    When invoking a remote function, such as via a
    [`ProcessPoolExecutor`][concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor]{target=_blank}
    or a FaaS system, on a proxy reference, the owner proxy will not know when
    the proxy references go out of scope on the remote process. This function
    will register a callback to the future returned by the function
    invocation method (`submit_func`) that will mark all proxy references in
    `args` and `kwargs` as out of scope once the future completes.

    Example:
        ```python
        from concurrent.futures import Future
        from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
        from proxystore.store.base import Store
        from proxystore.store.ref import borrow

        store = Store('example', ...)
        proxy = store.owned_proxy([1, 2, 3])
        borrowed = borrow(proxy)

        with ProcessPoolExecutor() as pool:
            future: Future[int] = submit(pool.submit, args=(sum, borrowed))
            assert future.result() == 6

        store.close()
        ```

    Tip:
        To return a proxy from the invoked function, return a normal
        [`Proxy`][proxystore.proxy.Proxy] and then call
        [`into_owned()`][proxystore.store.ref.into_owned] on the received
        result. Returning an [`OwnedProxy`][proxystore.store.ref.OwnedProxy]
        directly will often not work because the owned proxy will go out of
        scope when the function returns and the proxy is serialized causing
        the destructor of the owned proxy to evict the associated data.

    Args:
        submit_func: Function with submits a function with args and kwargs to
            be executed (e.g.,
            [`Executor.submit()`][concurrent.futures.Executor.submit]{target=_blank}).
        args: Positional arguments to pass to `submit_func`. Any proxy
            references in `args` will be registered to the scope cleanup
            callback.
        kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass to `submit_func`. Any proxy
            references in the values of `kwargs` will be registered to the
            scope cleanup callback.
        register_custom_refs: Iterable of additional proxy references to
            register to the scope cleanup callback. This is helpful if `args`
            or `kwargs` contain complex data structures containing more proxy
            references.
