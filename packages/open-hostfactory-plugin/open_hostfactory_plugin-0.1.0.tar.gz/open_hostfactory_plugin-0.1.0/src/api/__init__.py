"""API Layer Package.

This package contains the API layer components that handle external integrations
and provide interfaces for Symphony Host Factory and other external systems.

The API layer is responsible for:
    - Request/response handling
    - Data validation and transformation
    - Protocol-specific implementations
    - External system integration

Key Components:
    - handlers: Request handlers for different API endpoints
    - validators: Input validation and sanitization
    - transformers: Data transformation utilities

Architecture:
    The API layer sits at the boundary of the system and translates
    external requests into internal application commands and queries.

Note:
    This layer should remain thin and delegate business logic to
    the application layer.
