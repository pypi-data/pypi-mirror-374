"""
Domain Ports Package

This package contains interfaces (ports) that define the boundaries between
the domain layer and the infrastructure layer, following the Port-Adapter pattern
from Hexagonal Architecture.

Ports define what the domain needs from the outside world without specifying
how those needs are fulfilled. This allows the domain to remain independent
of infrastructure concerns.
