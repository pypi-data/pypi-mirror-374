"""Infrastructure Layer Package.

This package contains the infrastructure layer components that provide
technical capabilities and external system integrations for the application.

The infrastructure layer implements the technical concerns and provides
concrete implementations of the interfaces defined in the domain and
application layers.

Key Components:
    - persistence: Data storage and retrieval implementations
    - events: Event publishing and handling infrastructure
    - logging: Logging and monitoring utilities
    - config: Configuration management
    - di: Dependency injection container
    - interfaces: Technical interface definitions
    - utilities: Common infrastructure utilities

Architecture:
    The infrastructure layer depends on the application and domain layers
    but provides the technical foundation that enables the business logic
    to function in a real environment.

Responsibilities:
    - Database access and ORM
    - External API integrations
    - File system operations
    - Network communications
    - Caching mechanisms
    - Security implementations

Note:
    This layer should not contain business logic and should be easily
    replaceable without affecting the domain or application layers.
