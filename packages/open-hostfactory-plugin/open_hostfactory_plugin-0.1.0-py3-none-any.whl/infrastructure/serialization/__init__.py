"""Serialization Utilities Package.

This package provides serialization and deserialization utilities for
converting between different data formats and representations.

The serialization utilities support the persistence layer and external
integrations by providing consistent data transformation capabilities.

Key Components:
    - JSON serializers: JSON format handling
    - Object mappers: Object-to-data transformations
    - Type converters: Type-safe conversions
    - Format validators: Data format validation

Capabilities:
    - Domain object serialization
    - Configuration serialization
    - API request/response serialization
    - Persistence data transformation

Architecture:
    The serialization utilities are used throughout the infrastructure
    layer to ensure consistent data handling and format conversion.

Usage:
    These utilities are typically used by repositories, adapters, and
    external system integrations to convert between internal objects
    and external data formats.

Note:
    Serialization should preserve data integrity and handle version
    compatibility for long-term data storage.
