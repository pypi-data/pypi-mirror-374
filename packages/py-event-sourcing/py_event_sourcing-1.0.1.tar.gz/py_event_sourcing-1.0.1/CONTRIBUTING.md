## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or later
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/johnlogsdon/py-event-sourcing.git
   cd py-event-sourcing
   ```

2. **Set up the development environment:**
   ```bash
   uv sync --dev
   ```

3. **Install pre-commit hooks (recommended):**
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style
This project uses:
- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=py_event_sourcing

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest test/test_core.py
```

### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Format code
uv run black src/ test/

# Sort imports
uv run isort src/ test/

# Lint code
uv run flake8 src/ test/

# Type check
uv run mypy src/py_event_sourcing/
```

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes following the coding standards**

3. **Add tests for new functionality**

4. **Run the full test suite and quality checks:**
   ```bash
   uv run pytest --cov=py_event_sourcing
   uv run black --check src/ test/
   uv run isort --check-only src/ test/
   uv run flake8 src/ test/
   uv run mypy src/py_event_sourcing/
   ```

5. **Update documentation if needed**

6. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

7. **Push and create a pull request**
