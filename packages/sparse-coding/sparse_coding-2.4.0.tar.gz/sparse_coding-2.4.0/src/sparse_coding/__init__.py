Sparse Coding Library
===================

Based on: Olshausen & Field (1996) "Emergence of Simple-Cell Receptive Field Properties by Learning a Sparse Code for Natural Images"

This library implements the sparse coding algorithm that discovers
edge-like features from natural images, forming the foundation of modern computer vision.

üî¨ Research Foundation:
- Bruno Olshausen & David Field's sparse coding theory
- Dictionary Learning with overcomplete basis sets
- L1 Sparsity penalty for efficient coding
- Natural Image Statistics and preprocessing  
- Receptive Fields emergence through optimization
- Overcomplete Basis representation learning
- Efficient coding principles in biological vision

üéØ Key Features:
- Complete Olshausen & Field algorithm implementation
- Dictionary Learning with adaptive updates
- L1 Sparsity constraints and penalty functions
- Sparse feature extraction and encoding
- Overcomplete Basis dictionary construction
- Natural Image Statistics preprocessing
- Receptive Fields visualization
- Research-accurate implementations
