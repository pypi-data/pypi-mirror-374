## 🧠 Key Concepts

### ELI5 Explanation 🎯
Imagine your brain trying to understand a photo using the smallest possible set of "building blocks" (like LEGO pieces). Sparse coding finds these optimal building blocks by discovering that natural images can be reconstructed using only a few active "edge detectors" from a large dictionary of possible features.

### Mathematical Framework 🔢

#### Core Optimization Problem:
```
minimize: ||x - Da||₂² + λ * S(a)

where:
x = image patch (input data)
D = dictionary matrix (learned features)  
a = sparse activation vector (coefficients)
λ = sparsity parameter (controls sparseness)
S(a) = sparseness function
```

#### Olshausen & Field Equation (5):
```
τ * da_i/dt = Σ_j D_ij(x_j - Σ_k D_jk * a_k) - λ * ∂S(a_i)/∂a_i

where:
τ = time constant
D_ij = dictionary element at position (i,j)
S(a_i) = sparseness function (log, L1, gaussian, etc.)
```

### Key Research Insights 💡

1. **Overcomplete Basis**: More dictionary atoms than input dimensions (N > M)
2. **Natural Image Statistics**: Sparse coding reveals statistical structure in natural scenes  
3. **Biological Plausibility**: Learned features resemble V1 simple cell receptive fields
4. **Efficiency Principle**: Visual system evolved to minimize metabolic cost through sparse representations

## 🏗️ Implementation Notes

### Research Accuracy ✅
This implementation faithfully reproduces:
- **Exact equation (5)** from the original paper
- **Multiple sparseness functions** tested by Olshausen & Field:
  - `log(1 + x²)` - Primary choice in paper
  - `|x|` - L1 penalty (also tested)
  - `exp(-x²)` - Gaussian (mentioned)
- **Dictionary learning algorithm** with fixed-point iteration
- **Natural image preprocessing** with zero-phase whitening filter

### Modern Enhancements 🚀
**Added (without removing original functionality):**
- **FISTA optimization** - Fast convergence for L1 problems
- **Coordinate descent** - Proven optimal for L1-regularized objectives  
- **Additional sparseness functions** - Huber, elastic net, Cauchy, Student-t
- **Comprehensive configuration options** - Extensive user control

### Biological Inspiration 🧬
The algorithm mimics how the mammalian visual cortex processes images:
- **V1 simple cells** = Dictionary atoms (learned features)
- **Sparse activation** = Efficient neural firing patterns
- **Lateral inhibition** = Competitive dynamics between neurons
- **Hebbian learning** = "Neurons that fire together, wire together"
