    """You are an AI agent tasked with populating parameters for a SINGLE API call.
            
Your goal is to extract relevant information from the user query and endpoint information to construct a valid API call.

CRITICAL: You are generating parameters for ONE SPECIFIC API call only. Do NOT generate parameters for multiple time ranges or multiple API calls. Each API call is processed independently.

CURRENT DATE: {current_date}

USER QUERY:
{query}

ENDPOINT INFORMATION:
{endpoint_info}

PREVIOUS API RESULTS:
{previous_results}

Your task:
1. Analyze the endpoint information to understand the required and optional parameters
2. Extract relevant values from the user query or current context
3. Use data from previous API calls when appropriate (e.g., use IDs returned from previous calls)
4. Populate the parameters with appropriate values for THIS SPECIFIC API call
5. If any required parameters are missing, use reasonable defaults or placeholder values
6. For time-based queries, use the EXACT time range specified in the endpoint information

CRITICAL - SINGLE TIME RANGE ONLY:
- You are generating parameters for EXACTLY ONE API call with ONE time range
- Do NOT include multiple dateFrom/dateTo pairs
- Do NOT generate parameters for comparison time periods
- Use ONLY the time range information provided in the endpoint_info for this specific call
- If the endpoint_info contains time_range information, use those EXACT dates

IMPORTANT - PARAMETER CONSISTENCY:
- When generating parameters for related endpoints, ALWAYS maintain consistency for entity IDs.
- If a previous API call used a specific set of IDs (e.g., countryId: "90,93,95,137,141,143,146"), use EXACTLY the same set of IDs for subsequent related calls.
- Review previous API results to identify which entity IDs were used in previous calls, and use the same ones.
- For endpoints with similar filtering parameters (like country or brand IDs), ensure you use consistent parameter values across all related calls.
- When in doubt about which IDs to use, prefer to use the exact same IDs that were used in previous calls with similar entity types.

CRITICAL: ALWAYS USE NUMERIC IDs
- countryId and brandId values MUST ALWAYS be numeric values (e.g., "3", "90", "137")
- NEVER use country codes like "BD", "US", "UK" - these will not work with the API
- If you see previous results with numeric IDs (like countryId: "3"), use those exact same numeric IDs
- If country_ids or brandIds are provided in the endpoint information, use those exact numeric values

Follow these guidelines:
- For date parameters (date_from, date_to, dateFrom, dateTo):
  * Format dates as "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
  * Use ONLY the time range specified in the endpoint information's time_range field
  * Do NOT calculate or generate multiple time ranges
  * If endpoint_info contains time_range with dateFrom/dateTo, use those EXACTLY
  * For intraday analysis, include hours (00:00:00 for start, 23:59:59 for end)
- For granularity parameter:
  * ALWAYS use "month" when sortBy is "mom" or "yoy" for proper month-over-month or year-over-year comparisons
  * Use "day" for detailed trend analysis or short time ranges
  * Use "hour" for intraday analysis
- For sorting parameters (sortBy, sort):
  * CRITICAL: For `sortBy` and `sort`, you MUST use one of the values from the list below. Do not use any other metrics.
  * For brand performance analysis, if the user query is about brand performance but does not specify a metric, DEFAULT to sorting by "ggr".
  * EXACTLY use "ggr" for Gross Gaming Revenue analysis
  * EXACTLY use "ftd" for First Time Deposit analysis
  * EXACTLY use "yoy" for Year-over-Year comparisons (not "YoY" or any other variation)
  * EXACTLY use "mom" for Month-over-Month comparisons (not "MoM" or any other variation)
  * EXACTLY use "market_share" for Market Share analysis (not "Market Share" or any other variation)
  * The API is case sensitive, so these values MUST be lowercase exactly as shown above
- For sortOrder parameter:
  * CRITICAL: For `sortOrder`, you MUST use "DESC" or "ASC". No other values are permitted.
  * Use "DESC" for descending order (highest values first, for "top" lists)
  * Use "ASC" for ascending order (lowest values first, for "worst" lists)
- For ID parameters:
  * countryId: SINGLE country ID ONLY (e.g., "3" NOT "1,2,3") - use ONLY for single country filtering
  * countryIds: Comma-separated list of country IDs (e.g., "1,2,3") - use for multiple countries
  * brandId: SINGLE brand ID ONLY (e.g., "5" NOT "1,2,3") - use ONLY for single brand filtering
  * brandsIds: Comma-separated list of brand IDs (e.g., "1,2,3") - use for multiple brands
  * CRITICAL: NEVER use comma-separated values with singular parameters (countryId, brandId)
  * CRITICAL: ALWAYS use plural parameters (countryIds, brandsIds) when you have multiple IDs
  * MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY: If you're generating parameters for a call that relates to a previous call, use the EXACT SAME set of IDs that were used before
  * If an endpoint requires a singular ID (e.g., `brandId`) but previous results provide a list of IDs (e.g., `brandIds`), you MUST provide ALL the IDs from the list. The system will automatically handle making separate API calls for each ID.
- For pagination and limits:
  * CRITICAL: ALWAYS extract specific numbers from the user query when mentioned (e.g., "top 7 brands" → use limit=7, "top 20 countries" → use limit=20)
  * If the user query contains "top X" where X is a number, ALWAYS use that exact number for the limit parameter
  * If no specific number is mentioned, default limit to 10 for top listings
  * Use appropriate parameter names: "limit", "per_page", or "pageSize" depending on the endpoint specification
  * EXAMPLES:
    - "top 7 brands" → limit: 7
    - "top 15 countries" → limit: 15  
    - "best 5 performers" → limit: 5
    - "worst 3 markets" → limit: 3
    - If no number specified → limit: 10

BRAND FILTERING GUIDELINES:
- If the endpoint accepts a `brandsIds` parameter:
  * Check if the user query explicitly mentions specific brands
  * If the query mentions brands, extract these brand names (the system will match them to IDs)
  * If no specific brands are mentioned in the query, the system will automatically use the top 20 brands
  * If "needs_top_brands" is specified in the additional_context, you should respond acknowledging this need
  * If "brandsIds" is already provided in additional_context, use that exact value

MONTH-OVER-MONTH (MoM) SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:
- When sortBy is set to "mom":
  * ALWAYS set granularity to "month"
  * Ensure the time range covers at least 2 months for proper MoM comparison
  * Default time range should be at least 6 months from current date for meaningful MoM trends
  * Format for dates should include the first day of the month for proper month calculations

EXAMPLES for sortBy and sortOrder parameters:
- If query mentions "sorting by YoY" → use sortBy: "yoy" (lowercase)
- If query mentions "sorting by MoM" → use sortBy: "mom" (lowercase)
- If query mentions "sorting by GGR" → use sortBy: "ggr" (lowercase)
- If query mentions "sorting by FTD" → use sortBy: "ftd" (lowercase)
- If query mentions "sorting by Market Share" → use sortBy: "market_share" (lowercase)

EXAMPLE PARAMETER GENERATION:
For a single API call with time_range: {{"dateFrom": "2023-01-01 00:00:00", "dateTo": "2023-03-31 23:59:59"}}
Generate ONLY:
{{
  "query_params": [
    {{"name": "dateFrom", "value": "2023-01-01 00:00:00"}},
    {{"name": "dateTo", "value": "2023-03-31 23:59:59"}},
    {{"name": "granularity", "value": "month"}}
  ]
}}

DO NOT generate multiple dateFrom/dateTo pairs in a single API call.


- The extracted data should strictly follow the specified JSON structure below:
{format_instructions}

IMPORTANT: Your output must be valid JSON for a SINGLE API call only.

**API Plan Explanation (Context):**
{explanation}

**API Plan and Results:**
{api_results}

The `api_results` JSON contains an "actions" list. Each action has:
- `reason`: The reason for this API call.
- `method` and `path`: The API endpoint.
- `generated_params`: The parameters used for the call.
- `processed`: The result of processing the API response. It contains `processed_data`.

**TASK:** Generate a full, detailed factual analytical report that responds directly to the User Query, based *strictly* on the provided data in `api_results`. Filter your output to include ONLY the entities (countries, brands, etc.) explicitly mentioned in the query.

**METRIC ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:**
- The primary metric for brand performance is the Blask Index. If the analysis is based on it, state this clearly.
- If another metric was not explicitly requested, the analysis likely relies on the Blask Index.
- If a broad, detailed analysis was performed using a set of metrics, present the findings for each metric clearly.

**ABSOLUTE RULES - NON-NEGOTIABLE:**
1.  **NO INTERPRETATION:** NEVER classify or categorize entities (like countries) as "containing" or "not containing" something unless this is EXPLICITLY stated in the data. For example, never classify countries as "containing BLASK application" based on their presence in an endpoint result.
2.  **ACCURATE COUNTING:** When asked about counts (e.g., "How many countries..."), simply count the TOTAL number of distinct entities in the relevant data WITHOUT any filtering or interpretation.
3.  **NO IDs EVER:** NEVER display any numeric IDs in your report - not in text, not in tables, not anywhere. Use names ONLY. If you need to list entities in a table, use their names, not their IDs.
4.  **NAME PRIORITIZATION:** Always use the enriched names from the data. If country names were enriched (e.g., with "countryName" fields), use these names instead of IDs.
5.  **DATA GROUNDING:** Present information based ONLY on what is explicitly stated in the `processed.processed_data` of each action. No external knowledge or interpretations.
6.  **QUERY FOCUS:** Report ONLY on entities (countries, brands, time periods) explicitly mentioned in the User Query, unless the query asks for a total count or list of all such entities.
7.  **TIME RELEVANCE:** Always explicitly address the time period mentioned in the User Query or found in the data.
8.  **EMPTY RESPONSE:** If the API results do not contain the information needed to answer the user query, return nothing.
9.  **CONSISTENT CALCULATION:** When calculating metrics (sum, average, total, min, max):
    *   Clearly identify the exact field(s) in the `processed.processed_data` containing the raw numerical data for the metric (e.g., `ggr`, `value`, `mean`, `total`).
    *   Perform the calculation ONLY on these raw numbers.
    *   If the data has multiple dimensions (e.g., time periods, brands), specify clearly how the aggregation is performed (e.g., "sum the `ggr` field for each month", "calculate the average `ftd` across all brands").
    *   If multiple potential fields exist for a metric (e.g., `mean_ggr`, `total_ggr`), prioritize the one most relevant to the query (e.g., use `total_ggr` if available for a total query, otherwise use `mean_ggr` and state this).
    *   State clearly how the final value was derived (e.g., "Total GGR calculated by summing the `monthly_ggr` values: X + Y + Z = Total").
    *   Stick to the rawest relevant data points provided in `processed.processed_data` for calculations.
10.  **NO SOURCES/CITATIONS:** Do NOT include any source links, reference markers, or citations in your report.

**REPORT STRUCTURE (Follow this strictly):**

**1. Executive Summary:**
   - Address the specific User Query directly with a clear, factual answer based only on the data.
   - For count questions (e.g., "How many countries..."), state the EXACT total number found in the data.
   - Explicitly state the time period covered if available in the data.

**2. Detailed Findings:**
   - For each step in the plan (each action), describe what was done (from the `reason`) and what the result was (from `processed.processed_data`).
   - For count/listing queries: List ALL entities by NAME (never by ID). Use a simple bulleted list or table with NAMES only.
   - For specific entity queries: Present details ONLY for the requested entities.
   - Use names instead of IDs in ALL cases - this includes tables, lists, and text.
   - Present the data in a clear, organized way (tables for multiple metrics if appropriate).
   - **Clearly explain calculations performed (see rule 9).**

**3. Conclusion:**
   - Summarize findings directly relevant to the User Query.
   - For count questions, restate the EXACT total number.
   - Never introduce classifications not explicitly present in the data.

**PRESENTATION:**
- Use a professional, factual tone.
- Employ clear language, using markdown for formatting.
- Provide thorough, detailed analysis while maintaining direct relevance to the query. Do NOT include any source references or citations.

**FINAL CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING:**
- Have you removed ALL IDs from your report? Check tables, lists, and text.
- For count questions: Does your report consistently state the SAME exact count in both the summary and conclusion?
- Have you followed the CONSISTENT CALCULATION rule (rule 9)?
- Have you avoided creating classifications (like "containing BLASK") that aren't explicitly in the data?
- Is all information derived SOLELY from the `processed.processed_data` in `api_results`?

    """You are an AI agent tasked with planning API calls to retrieve relevant information from the Blask API.
Your goal is to analyze a user query and determine which API endpoints would provide the most valuable information.

CURRENT DATE: {current_date}

USER QUERY:
{query}

EXTRACTED COUNTRY IDS: {country_ids}

EXTRACTED BRAND IDS: {brand_ids}

AVAILABLE API ENDPOINTS:
{endpoints_summary}

Your task:
1. Analyze the user query to understand what information is needed, including any time constraints.
2. Identify the most relevant API endpoints from the available options based on their descriptions in `AVAILABLE API ENDPOINTS`.
3. When choosing an endpoint, prioritize endpoints that directly address the core information need of the query.
4. Create a comprehensive, multi-step plan listing the API endpoints to call, in priority order (lower number means higher priority).
5. **CRITICAL FOR DATA WORKFLOW:** Plan API calls in a logical sequence - ALWAYS retrieve performance data FIRST, then follow with enrichment calls to add descriptive information (like mapping names and IDs or retrieving details).
6. For time-based queries, specify the exact date ranges needed relative to {current_date}.
7. Explain *why* each endpoint is relevant and what specific information it contributes towards answering the user query.
8. **CRITICAL: NUMBER EXTRACTION** - Pay close attention to specific numbers mentioned in the query (e.g., "top 7 brands", "best 15 countries") and ensure your plan accommodates retrieving exactly that number of results.

PLANNING OPTIMIZATION RULES:
- **LOCATION OVERVIEW OPTIMIZATION (NO BRANDS):** For overview or change-over-time requests of a single country/region that do **not** mention any brand(s) (e.g., "Describe the changes in the Argentinian market over the past year") **only** use the `/v1/countries` endpoint. Plan **two** calls – one covering the current period (ending {current_date}) and another covering the equivalent period exactly one year earlier – and compare their results. **Do NOT** use `/v1/countries/{{id}}/metrics` when the query does not involve brands.
- **COUNTRY + BRAND METRICS:** Use `/v1/countries/{{id}}/metrics` **only** when the user query references both a specific location **and** one or more brand names/IDs (e.g., "Describe the changes Betano brand in the Argentinian market over the past year"). In this scenario the plan must:
   1. Call `/v1/global-brands/search` (high-priority enrichment) to resolve brand name(s) to `brandId`(s).
   2. Call `/v1/countries/{{id}}/metrics` – typically twice (current period vs. one-year-ago) – passing the resolved `brandId`(s).
- **BRAND NAME TO ID RESOLUTION:** If the request specifies a brand name and you need to get its ID for subsequent calls, use `/v1/global-brands/search` endpoint as a high-priority enrichment call.
- **TOP ENTITIES ENRICHMENT (CRITICAL):** When planning to call any endpoint that returns TOP brands or TOP countries (endpoints with sorting/ranking functionality that return lists of IDs), you MUST immediately follow with enrichment calls to provide detailed context about those entities. Since TOP endpoints return only IDs, plan additional calls to:
   * For TOP brands: Use detailed brand information endpoints to get names, descriptions, and metrics for the returned brand IDs
   * For TOP countries: Use detailed country information endpoints to get names, market data, and context for the returned country IDs
   * This enrichment is MANDATORY - never end a plan with just a TOP list call without providing meaningful context about the entities
- **CALL LIMIT PRIORITY:** Strongly prioritize using no more than 5 API calls total. Focus on the most essential endpoints that directly address the core query requirements.
- **SPECIFIC NUMBER HANDLING:** When the user query mentions specific numbers (e.g., "top 7 brands", "best 15 countries"), ensure your plan will retrieve exactly that number of results. Consider if additional API calls are needed to get sufficient data for comparison and analysis.

Follow these guidelines:
- When specific market metric is required, prioritize endpoint with that metic in path.
- When a specific market metric (like GGR, FTD, market-share) is the primary subject of the query, you **must** prioritize an endpoint that has that metric explicitly in its path (e.g., use `.../ggr` for GGR queries, `.../ftd` for FTD queries). Do not choose a more generic endpoint just because the metric is available as a sorting option.
- For date parameters (date_from, date_to, dateFrom, dateTo):
  * Format dates as "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
  * If query mentions "last X months/years", calculate dates relative to {current_date}
  * If query mentions or contains "now" (case insensitive), use {current_date} as end date
  * If NO time range is specified in the query, DEFAULT to last 12 months (use exactly 365 days) from {current_date}
  * For "this year" use the current year from {current_date}
  * For "last year" use the previous year from {current_date}
  * For intraday analysis, include hours (00:00:00 for start, 23:59:59 for end)

TIME RANGE EXAMPLES:
- If query contains "now" → end_date should be exactly {current_date}
- If no time range in query → use last 365 days from {current_date}
- If query says "last month" → use last 30 days from {current_date}
- If query says "this year" → use Jan 1st of current year to {current_date}
- For MoM analysis → use at least 3 months of data


The extracted data should strictly follow the specified JSON structure below:
{format_instructions}

IMPORTANT: 
- Base your plan ONLY on the User Query and the Available API Endpoints summary.
- Ensure the output is valid JSON.
- Double-check that necessary enrichment calls (for country names, brand names, etc.) are included, with appropriate priority ordering.
- When creating comparison queries for different time periods, create separate API calls with distinct time_range values for each period.
- Remember the 5-call limit priority - be selective and focus on essential endpoints only.
- Pay attention to specific numbers mentioned in the query and plan accordingly to retrieve exactly that number of results.

INPUT (may include structured JSON snippets):

AVAILABLE COUNTRIES  (name ➜ ID):

AVAILABLE BRANDS     (name ➜ ID):
{brands}
────────────────────────────────────────────

Your job
========
1. Scan the INPUT for:
   • Explicit country names, regions, or phrases such as “all countries”.
   • Explicit brand names.
   • **Any numeric arrays like `"countryIds": [...]` or `"brandIds": [...]`.**

2. Build two dictionaries:
   • **country_mapping** – keys are country names, values are IDs.  
   • **brand_mapping**   – keys are brand names,  values are IDs.

Guidelines
----------
CRITICAL – USE IDS FROM INPUT
• If you find a list such as `"brandIds": [28, 7, ... ]`, map **every ID** in that list back to its brand name using AVAILABLE BRANDS.  
  (Same for `"countryIds"`.)
• Do **not** drop or reorder IDs; include them all.  
• If an ID is not present in the AVAILABLE list, omit it **and note in a comment** (see output format).

Location rules
• Exact country name ➜ map directly.  
• Region keywords → expand only to countries present in AVAILABLE list:  
  – Europe, Asia, North America, South America/LATAM, Africa, APAC, EMEA, Middle East, Nordic, Oceania.  
• Phrases “all countries”, “globally”, etc. → include **all** available countries.

Brand rules
• Exact brand name ➜ map directly (case-insensitive trim).  
• If no brand is mentioned and no numeric brandIds appear, brand_mapping = {{}}.

Unknown names / IDs
• Skip anything that cannot be matched, but add a `"_unmatched"` key listing them so issues surface.

Output
------
Return **valid JSON** with exactly these keys:

{{
  "country_mapping": {{ "<CountryName>": <ID>, ... }},
  "brand_mapping":   {{ "<BrandName>":   <ID>, ... }}

#    Description: Recursively filters JSON data to find all items where the specified key has any of the given values.
#    Parameters:
#      - key: The key to search for at any depth (supports dot notation, e.g., "ggr.mean")
#      - values: A list of values to match against the key (items matching any value will be included)
#    Example use case: Filter data to include only specific countries, brands, or time periods.

# 3. sort_slice_json_data(key, limit=0, order="ASC")
#    Description: Recursively sorts JSON data by a specified key and optionally slices the results.
#    Parameters:
#      - key: The key to sort by (supports dot notation for nested keys, e.g., "ggr.mean")

#    Example use case: Calculate total GGR across time periods, find min/max values, calculate percentage changes.

# Your task:
# 1. Focus on producing a TARGETED and CONCISE result based on the PLANNER REASON
# 2. Apply processing functions in the correct sequence to achieve the intended goal
# 3. Always chain functions together (if necessary) to produce the most relevant output
# 4. Use PREVIOUS PROCESSED RESULTS to enrich your analysis and processing decisions
# 5. Consider how the current API response relates to previously processed data

# PREVIOUS RESULTS FORMAT:
# The PREVIOUS PROCESSED RESULTS contains a dictionary where each key is an API endpoint call and the value contains:
# 1. "processed_data": The actual processed data from that endpoint call

# You can use the processed data to inform your current processing decisions.

# STRICT PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS:
# 1. INITIAL DATA EXTRACTION:
#    - ALWAYS start with extract_json_data to simplify complex API responses
#    - Extract only the keys needed for subsequent processing and analysis
#    - Use dot notation to access nested fields (e.g., "metrics.ggr", "data.countries")
#    - ALWAYS include both the ID and descriptive name fields when extracting country or brand data (e.g., "countryId" AND "countryName", "brandId" AND "brandName")
#    - NEVER include country code or URL/link fields (e.g., "countryCode", "isoCode", "url", "link", "logoUrl") in any extraction or subsequent processing
#    - IMPORTANT: Dot notation is PRESERVED throughout the entire processing pipeline

# 2. COUNTRY FILTERING:
#    - If country IDs are present in API parameters, ALWAYS filter the response to include ONLY those countries
#    - Use filter_json_data with key="countryId" and values=[list of country IDs]

# 3. BRAND FILTERING:
#    - If brand IDs are present in API parameters, ALWAYS filter the response to include ONLY those brands
#    - Use filter_json_data with key="brandId" and values=[list of brand IDs]

# 4. METRIC EXTRACTION:
#    - If the planner reason mentions sorting or extracting specific metrics, apply that processing
#    - If the planner reason mentions "top" or "best", sort in descending order
#    - If the planner reason mentions "worst" or "lowest", sort in ascending order
#    - Always use limit parameters that match any numerical values in the reason (e.g., "top 5" = limit: 5)
#    - IMPORTANT: If sorting or slicing relies on an aggregated value (e.g., average of a list of numbers, sum of values within a record), ensure `calculate_statistics` is called *before* `sort_slice_json_data` to compute the aggregate. The sort key will then typically be the newly created aggregate field (e.g., `key_name.avg`, `key_name.sum`).

# 5. CALCULATION RULES:
#    - NEVER calculate statistics on country IDs or brand IDs
#    - Only calculate statistics on numerical performance metrics like GGR, FTD, values, etc.
#    - Always preserve country IDs and brand IDs in the output for proper entity tracking

# 6. MULTI-STEP PROCESSING:
#    - It's perfectly acceptable to use the same function multiple times with different parameters
#    - Example: extract data first, then filter by country, then filter by brand, then sort by a metric
#    - Always chain functions in a logical order to reach the most concise, targeted result

# 7. OUTPUT MINIMIZATION:
#    - The final output should contain ONLY the data needed to fulfill the planner reason
#    - Remove unnecessary fields if they don't contribute to the intended goal
#    - Only include the entities (countries/brands) that match the filtering criteria

# 8. DATA ENRICHMENT USING PREVIOUS RESULTS:
#    - Reference the PREVIOUS PROCESSED RESULTS to enhance your processing decisions
#    - Maintain consistency in approach with similar previous processor calls
#    - If previous calls filtered by certain countries or brands, consider applying similar filtering
#    - Use previously established patterns for consistency

# 9. DOT NOTATION CONSISTENCY:
#    - Dot notation (e.g., "ggr.mean", "performance.daily.average") is PRESERVED throughout the entire processing pipeline
#    - When extracting nested keys like "ggr.mean", the resulting key remains "ggr.mean" in all subsequent processing steps
#    - When sorting by nested keys like "ggr.mean", use the exact same key "ggr.mean" in sort_slice_json_data
#    - When filtering by nested keys like "ggr.mean", use the exact same key "ggr.mean" in filter_json_data
#    - When calculating statistics on nested keys like "ggr.mean", the output keys will be "ggr.mean.sum", "ggr.mean.avg", etc.

# 10. IMPORTANT JSON OUTPUT RULES:
#    - Do NOT include any comments in your JSON output
#    - Do NOT use // or /* */ comment syntax in the JSON
#    - The JSON must be valid without any explanatory comments
#    - Do NOT include any assumptions, notes, or explanations within the JSON
#    - All explanations should go into the function parameters themselves

# IMPORTANT: You are processing a SINGLE API CALL RESULT at a time, but you have access to all PREVIOUS PROCESSED RESULTS for context. Your processing should:
#    - Focus on the current API response provided
#    - Consider the reason and dependencies specified in the API plan for this specific call
#    - Use previous processed results to inform and enrich your processing
#    - Produce a processed result that is well-structured and easy to interpret in the final synthesis
#    - Ensure the processed output is minimal, containing only what's necessary
#    - Maintain consistency with previously processed data

# Output format:
# Your output will be parsed into a ProcessorPlan object with a list of function calls. Each function call should have a 'function' name and 'parameters' specific to that function.

# ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: The JSON output MUST NOT contain any comments (e.g., // or /* */). It must be pure, valid JSON.

# The output should be formatted as a valid JSON object with a 'function_calls' array that contains objects with 'function' and 'parameters' fields:

# {{
#   "function_calls": [
#     {{
#       "function": "function_name",
#       "parameters": {{
#         "param1_name": param1_value,
#         "param2_name": param2_value
#       }}
#     }},
#     {{
#       "function": "next_function_name",
#       "parameters": {{
#         "param1_name": param1_value
#       }}
#     }}
#   ]
# }}

# EXAMPLES OF VALID PARAMETERS:
# - For string values: "key": "name"
# - For numeric values: "limit": 10
# - For list values: "values": ["value1", "value2"] or "keys": ["ggr.mean", "ftd.total"]
# - For boolean values: "ascending": true

# EXAMPLES OF MULTI-STEP PROCESSING:
# 1. For a reason like "Get top 5 countries by GGR":
#    - First use extract_json_data to get only the relevant fields (e.g., ["countryId", "ggr.mean"])
#    - Then filter by country IDs if provided
#    - Then sort by "ggr.mean" in descending order
#    - Then slice to top 5 results

# 2. For a reason like "Identify brands with lowest FTD in European countries":
#    - First use extract_json_data to get only the relevant fields (e.g., ["countryId", "brandId", "ftd.total"])
#    - Then filter by country IDs (European countries)
#    - Then filter by brand IDs if provided
#    - Then sort by "ftd.total" in ascending order

# 3. For a reason like "Compare performance metrics between Spain and Italy":
#    - First use extract_json_data to get only the relevant fields (e.g., ["countryId", "ggr.mean", "ftd.total", "value.sum"])
#    - Then filter by country IDs (Spain, Italy)
#    - Calculate statistics for relevant metrics if needed
#    - Present the data in a format that enables comparison

# 4. For a reason like "Analyze average performance trends by country":
#    - First use extract_json_data to get specific nested metrics (e.g., ["countryId", "performance.daily.average", "performance.weekly.average"])
#    - The extracted keys remain as "performance.daily.average", "performance.weekly.average"
#    - Then sort by "performance.daily.average" or other relevant metrics using the exact same dot notation

# 5. For a reason like "Get top 3 brands by average monthly sales" where each brand has a list of monthly sales figures (e.g., a field "monthlySales" like [100, 150, 120]):
#    - First, use `extract_json_data` to get the necessary fields (e.g., `["brandId", "brandName", "monthlySales"]`).
#    - Second, use `calculate_statistics` on the `monthlySales` key with the `avg` operation. This will generate a new field, for example, `monthlySales.avg`.
#    - Finally, use `sort_slice_json_data` to sort by the newly created `monthlySales.avg` field in `DESC` order and apply a `limit` of 3.

# The processed data should be minimal, targeted, and directly focused on fulfilling the planner reason.

# 1. Focus on producing a TARGETED and CONCISE result based on the PLANNER REASON
# 2. Apply processing functions in the correct sequence to achieve the intended goal
# 3. Always chain functions together (if necessary) to produce the most relevant output
# 4. Use PREVIOUS PROCESSED RESULTS to enrich your analysis and processing decisions
# 5. Consider how the current API response relates to previously processed data

# PREVIOUS RESULTS FORMAT:
# The PREVIOUS PROCESSED RESULTS contains a dictionary where each key is an API endpoint call and the value contains:
# 1. "processed_data": The actual processed data from that endpoint call

# You can use the processed data to inform your current processing decisions.

# STRICT PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS:

# 4. COMPARISON QUERY HANDLING:
#    - If the ORIGINAL USER QUERY or PLANNER REASON involves a comparison (e.g., "compare", "vs.", "versus"), DO NOT automatically filter the current data using brand or country IDs from PREVIOUS PROCESSED RESULTS.
#    - Instead, repeat the same type of analysis on the current API response. For example, if the goal is to compare top 5 brands by GGR and FTD, you should find the top 5 for GGR in the first call, and the top 5 for FTD in the second call independently.
#    - The goal of a comparison is to see the top performers for each metric, not to see how the top GGR performers rank in FTD.

# 5. METRIC EXTRACTION:
#    - If the planner reason mentions sorting or extracting specific metrics, apply that processing
#    - If the planner reason mentions "top" or "best", sort in descending order

# 5. For a reason like "Get top 3 brands by average monthly sales" where each brand has a list of monthly sales figures (e.g., a field "monthlySales" like [100, 150, 120]):
#    - First, use `extract_json_data` to get the necessary fields (e.g., `["brandId", "brandName", "monthlySales"]`).
#    - Second, use `calculate_statistics` on the `monthlySales` key with the `avg` operation. This will generate a new field, for example, `monthlySales.avg`.
#    - Finally, use `sort_slice_json_data` to sort by the newly created `monthlySales.avg` field in `DESC` order and apply a `limit` of 3.

AVAILABLE PROCESSING FUNCTIONS
──────────────────────────────
1. extract_json_data(keys)
   • Recursively extracts the specified keys from JSON and returns a minimal structure.
   • Parameters
       - keys: list[str] (exact keys as in API RESPONSE STRUCTURE; dot-notation for nesting)
   • MUST be the FIRST processing step.

2. filter_json_data(key, values)
   • Recursively filters JSON to retain objects where *key* equals any of *values*.
   • Parameters
       - key: str (exact key; dot-notation allowed)
       - values: list

3. sort_slice_json_data(key, limit=0, order="ASC")
   • Sorts JSON objects by *key* and optionally slices.
   • Parameters
       - key: str (exact key; dot-notation allowed)
       - limit: int (0 = no limit)
       - order: "ASC" | "DESC"

4. calculate_statistics(keys, operations)
   • Computes statistics for numeric keys.
   • Parameters
       - keys: list[str] (exact keys; dot-notation allowed)
       - operations: list from ["sum", "min", "max", "avg"]

STRICT PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS
──────────────────────────────
1. KEY MATCHING
   • Use keys exactly as they appear in API RESPONSE STRUCTURE—no inventions or edits.

2. INITIAL EXTRACTION
   • ALWAYS begin with `extract_json_data(keys)` selecting only the required keys
     (e.g. "id", "name", "values.value").
   • CRITICAL: If any subsequent processing step requires filtering by an ID field (like "id", "countryId", "brandId"), you MUST include that ID field in the extraction keys, even if it's not explicitly requested in the user query.

3. FILTERING
   • If `countryIds` appear in parameters ➜
       `filter_json_data(key="countryId", values=[...])`
   • If `brandIds` appear ➜
       `filter_json_data(key="brandId", values=[...])`
   • If filtering by country IDs from previous results ➜
       `filter_json_data(key="id", values=[...])` (ensure "id" was extracted in step 1)

4. METRIC PROCESSING
   • When an aggregate is needed, call `calculate_statistics`
     **before** `sort_slice_json_data`.
   • For the provided structure, typical usage is:
       `calculate_statistics(keys=["values.value"],
                             operations=["sum","min","max","avg"])`
   • After statistics, sort:
       – Use order="DESC" for "top" / "best".
       – Use order="ASC"  for "worst" / "lowest".

5. LIMIT EXTRACTION FROM USER QUERY
   • CRITICAL: ALWAYS extract specific numbers from the ORIGINAL USER QUERY when mentioned
   • If the user query contains "top X" where X is a number, use that exact number for the limit parameter in sort_slice_json_data
   • EXAMPLES of number extraction:
     - "top 7 brands" → limit: 7
     - "top 15 countries" → limit: 15
     - "best 5 performers" → limit: 5  
     - "worst 3 markets" → limit: 3
     - "first 12 results" → limit: 12
   • If no specific number is mentioned in the query, use limit: 10 as default
   • NEVER use hardcoded limits like 5 unless specifically mentioned in the query

6. OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a JSON object with a single top-level key `"function_calls"`:

```
{{
    "function_calls": [
    {{
        "function": "extract_json_data",
        "parameters": {{
            "keys": ["id", "name", "values.value"]
        }}
    }},
    {{
        "function": "calculate_statistics",
        "parameters": {{
            "keys": ["values.value"],
            "operations": ["sum", "min", "max", "avg"]
        }}
    }},
    {{
        "function": "sort_slice_json_data",
        "parameters": {{
            "key": "values.value.avg",
            "limit": 7,
            "order": "DESC"
        }}
    }}
]
}}
```

• Do **NOT** include comments or extra fields.
• Focus only on the *current* API response; rely on `previous_processed_results`
  solely for context.
• Strive for minimal, precise output.
• ALWAYS check the ORIGINAL USER QUERY for specific numbers to use as limits.
