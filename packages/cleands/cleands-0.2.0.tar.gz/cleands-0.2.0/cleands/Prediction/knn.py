"""
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) regression models.

This module implements kNN regression using squared Euclidean distance.
Predictions are made by averaging the target values of the k nearest training
samples. A cross-validation variant is also included to automatically select
the optimal number of neighbors.

Classes:
    k_nearest_neighbors_regressor:
        Basic kNN regressor that predicts by averaging the outcomes of the
        k closest training samples.

    k_nearest_neighbors_cross_validation_regressor:
        Extension of kNN regressor that selects the best k (up to k_max)
        using k-fold cross-validation to minimize mean squared prediction error.

Notes:
    - Distance computation uses precomputed squared L2 norms for efficiency.
    - The cross-validation model defaults to 5 folds and evaluates k from 1
      up to `k_max` (default 25).
