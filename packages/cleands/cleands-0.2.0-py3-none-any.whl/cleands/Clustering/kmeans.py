"""
k-means clustering models.

This module implements a basic version of k-means clustering (`simple_k_means`)
and a multi-start variant (`k_means`). It also includes helper functions to
evaluate the optimal number of clusters using the total within-group sum of
squares (TWSS) and the "elbow method".

Classes:
    simple_k_means:
        Basic k-means clustering algorithm with iterative centroid updates.

    k_means:
        Extension of `simple_k_means` that runs multiple random initializations
        (n_start) and selects the solution with the lowest TWSS.

Functions:
    total_within_group_sum_of_squares_for_different_k:
        Computes TWSS across different k values (1..k_max).

    select_k:
        Heuristic to choose optimal k using the elbow method based on TWSS ratios.
