    A [Session][diffusion.session.Session] lock.

    Notes:
        A session lock is a server-managed resource
        that can be used to coordinate exclusive access
        to shared resources across sessions.
        For example,
        to ensure a single session has the right to update a topic;
        to ensure at most one session responds to an event;
        or to select a single session to perform a housekeeping task.
        Session locks support general collaborative locking schemes.
        The application architect is responsible for
        designing a suitable locking scheme
        and for ensuring each application component
        follows the scheme appropriately.

        Session locks are identified by a lock name.
        Lock names are arbitrary
        and chosen at will to suit the application.
        Each lock is owned by at most one session.
        Locks are established on demand;
        there is no separate operation to create or destroy a lock.

        A session lock is acquired using the
        [Session.lock][diffusion.session.Session.lock] method.
        If no other session owns the lock,
        the server will assign the lock to the calling session immediately.
        Otherwise,
        the server will record that the session is waiting to acquire the lock.
        A session can call
        [Session.lock][diffusion.session.Session.lock]
        more than once for a given session lock
        â€“ if the lock is acquired,
        all calls will complete successfully with equal
        [SessionLock][diffusion.session.locks.session_locks.SessionLock] values.

        If a session closes,
        the session locks it owns are automatically released.
        A session can also release a lock by calling
        [SessionLock.unlock][diffusion.session.locks.session_locks.SessionLock.unlock].
        When a session lock is released
        and other sessions are waiting to acquire the lock,
        the server will arbitrarily select one of the waiting sessions
        and notify it that it has acquired the lock.
        All of the newly selected session's pending
        [Session.lock][diffusion.session.Session.lock]
        calls will complete normally.
        Other sessions will continue to wait.

        The [Session.lock][diffusion.session.Session.lock]
        variant of this method takes a scope parameter
        that provides the further option of automatically releasing the lock
        when the session loses its connection to the server.

        # Race conditions

        This session lock API has inherent race conditions.
        Even if an application is coded correctly
        to protect a shared resource using session locks,
        there may be a period where two
        or more sessions concurrently access the resource.
        The races arise for several reasons including

        - Due to the <i>check-then-act</i>
        approach of polling <see cref="IsOwned"/>,
        the lock can be lost after the check has succeeded
        but before the resource is accessed;

        - The server can detect a session is disconnected
        and assign the lock to another session
        before the original session has detected the disconnection.

        Despite this imprecision,
        session locks provide a useful way to coordinate session actions.
