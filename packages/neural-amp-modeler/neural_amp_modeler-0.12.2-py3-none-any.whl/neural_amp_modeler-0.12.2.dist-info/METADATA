# NAM: Neural Amp Modeler

This repository handles training, reamping, and exporting the weights of a model.
For playing trained models in real time in a standalone application or plugin, see the partner repo,
[NeuralAmpModelerPlugin](https://github.com/sdatkinson/NeuralAmpModelerPlugin).

For more information about the NAM ecosystem please check out https://www.neuralampmodeler.com/.
