"""Packet generator utilities for CCSDS packets.

The parsing begins with binary data representing CCSDS Packets. A user can then create a generator
from the binary data reading from a filelike object or a socket. The ``ccsds_generator`` function yields
``CCSDSPacketBytes`` objects that are the raw binary data of a single CCSDS packet. The ``CCSDSPacketBytes``
class can be used to inspect the CCSDS header fields of the packet, but it does not have any
parsed content from the data field. This generator is useful for debugging and passing off
to other parsing functions.

    packets that are split into multiple packets due to size constraints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    binary_data : Union[BinaryIO, socket.socket, bytes]
        Binary data source containing CCSDSPackets.
    buffer_read_size_bytes : int, optional
        Number of bytes to read from e.g. a BufferedReader or socket binary data source on each read attempt.
        If None, defaults to 4096 bytes from a socket, -1 (full read) from a file.
    show_progress : bool
        Default False.
        If True, prints a status bar. Note that for socket sources, the percentage will be zero until the generator
        ends.
    skip_header_bytes : int
        Default 0. The parser skips this many bytes at the beginning of every packet. This allows dynamic stripping
        of additional header data that may be prepended to packets in "raw record" file formats.
    combine_segmented_packets : bool
        Default False. If True, combines segmented packets into a single packet for parsing. This is useful for
        parsing packets that are split into multiple packets due to size constraints. The packet data is combined
        by concatenating the data from each packet together. The combined packet is then parsed as a single packet.
        Only the first CCSDS header is kept when concatenating continued packets. CCSDS headers (and secondary headers)
        from continuation packets are discarded.
    secondary_header_bytes : int
        Default 0. The length of the secondary header in bytes.
        This is used to skip the secondary header of segmented packets.
        The byte layout within the returned packet has all data concatenated together as follows:
        [packet0header, packet0secondaryheader, packet0data, packet1data, packet2data, ...].
