    # not exist in the dict, in the C++ transpiled code a KeyError won't be raised, and
    # undefined behaviour will happen. Using dg instead will result in the same
    # behavior in the C++ build, since a KeyError will the thrown.
    # tldr; dict[index] can be used if you know index is in the dict. If it isn't in the
    # dict, C++ will have undefined behavior.
