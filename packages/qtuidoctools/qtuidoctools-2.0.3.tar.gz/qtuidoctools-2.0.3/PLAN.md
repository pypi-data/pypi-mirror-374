# qtuidoctools Modernization Plan

## 1. Project Overview and Objectives

This plan addresses the modernization of the qtuidoctools project to ensure Python 3.11+ compliance, modern packaging standards, and best development practices. The project is a Qt UI documentation tool that extracts widgets from .ui files and generates YAML documentation and JSON help files.

**Critical Constraint**: The code currently works and MUST remain functional. All changes are surgical improvements, not refactoring.


## 2. Important: Parallelization

### 2.1. Performance Analysis

**Current Bottleneck**: The `qtuidoctools update` command processes .ui files sequentially, causing slow performance on projects with many UI files.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Sequential File Processing**: Each .ui file is processed one at a time in `__main__.py` lines 114-142
2. **Heavy I/O Operations**: Each file involves:
   - XML parsing with lxml (CPU-intensive)
   - YAML file reading/writing (I/O-intensive) 
   - TOC file updates (I/O-intensive, potential file locking)
3. **No Resource Utilization**: Modern multi-core systems are underutilized

### 2.2. Parallelization Strategy

**Objective**: Reduce processing time by parallelizing independent .ui file processing while maintaining data integrity.

#### 2.2.1. Parallel Processing Architecture

**Approach**: Use `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` for CPU-bound tasks and `ThreadPoolExecutor` for I/O-bound operations.

**Key Design Principles**:
1. **File-Level Parallelization**: Each .ui file can be processed independently
2. **Shared Resource Protection**: TOC file updates require coordination
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Avoid loading all files into memory simultaneously
4. **Error Isolation**: One file's errors shouldn't crash the entire operation
5. **Progress Reporting**: Maintain user feedback during long operations

#### 2.2.2. Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Independent File Processing**
- Extract widget data from .ui files in parallel processes
- Generate individual YAML files in parallel  
- Collect TOC updates for later consolidation

**Phase 2: Shared Resource Coordination** 
- Consolidate TOC updates in main process
- Handle any shared state operations sequentially

**Phase 3: Performance Optimization**
- Implement batching for small files
- Add configurable worker pool sizes
- Optimize memory usage patterns

#### 2.2.3. Technical Implementation Details

**Process Pool for CPU-Intensive Tasks**:
- XML parsing and widget extraction
- YAML data generation
- Text processing operations

**Thread Pool for I/O-Intensive Tasks**:
- File reading and writing
- Directory scanning
- YAML file operations

**Coordination Mechanisms**:
- Lock-free TOC accumulation using process-safe data structures
- Result aggregation in main process
- Atomic file operations where possible

#### 2.2.4. Compatibility and Safety

**Backward Compatibility**:
- Maintain identical CLI interface
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Keep same output formats and behavior

**Data Integrity**:
- Ensure TOC consistency across parallel operations
- Prevent race conditions on shared files
- Maintain transactional semantics for file updates

**Error Handling**:
- Graceful degradation to sequential processing on errors
- Per-file error reporting without stopping entire operation
- Proper cleanup of partial results

### 2.3. Expected Performance Improvements

**Theoretical Speedup**: 
- On 8-core systems: 4-6x improvement for CPU-bound operations
- For I/O-bound operations: 2-3x improvement through overlapping
- Combined: 3-5x overall processing time reduction

**Real-world Factors**:
- File size distribution affects parallelization efficiency
- I/O subsystem performance limits
- Memory constraints on very large projects

### 2.4. Implementation Phases

**Phase A: Core Parallel Processing**
1. Refactor UIDoc.updateXmlAndYaml() to be process-safe
2. Implement parallel file discovery and batching
3. Create worker function for independent file processing
4. Add process pool management with configurable worker count

**Phase B: Shared Resource Management**
1. Implement TOC accumulation strategy  
2. Add file locking mechanisms where needed
3. Create result consolidation pipeline
4. Ensure atomic operations for critical updates

**Phase C: Optimization and Monitoring**
1. Add progress reporting with file counts and timing
2. Implement adaptive batch sizing based on file sizes
3. Add memory usage monitoring and limits
4. Create performance profiling and benchmarking tools

**Phase D: Testing and Validation** 
1. Comprehensive testing with large UI file sets
2. Race condition and concurrency testing
3. Performance benchmarking across different system configurations
4. Backwards compatibility validation
