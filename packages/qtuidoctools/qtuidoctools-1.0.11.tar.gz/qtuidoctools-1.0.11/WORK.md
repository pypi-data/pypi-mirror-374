# Current Work Progress

## Active Tasks

### 1. Testing Infrastructure Setup (Step 5)
**Status**: Ready to start
**Objective**: Add comprehensive test coverage for existing functionality

#### Current Task: Set up Testing Structure  
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests/ directory structure
- [ ] Add pytest configuration to pyproject.toml (already done)
- [ ] Create test_qtui.py with UIDoc class tests
- [ ] Create test_qtuibuild.py with UIBuild class tests
- [ ] Fix existing test_textutils.py (5 failing tests identified)
- [ ] Ensure >90% test coverage
- [ ] Run `pytest --cov=src/qtuidoctools` successfully

### 2. Documentation Updates  
**Status**: Pending
**Dependencies**: Complete testing infrastructure first

## Completed Recent Work

### ✅ CLI Framework Migration (Step 4) 
**Completed**: CLI migration from Click to Fire framework
- ✅ Dependencies already had fire>=0.5.0, no click dependency found
- ✅ __main__.py was already converted to Fire with QtUIDocTools class

- ✅ Entry point correctly uses fire.Fire(QtUIDocTools)  
- ✅ Updated CLI tests from Click's CliRunner to subprocess calls for Fire
- ✅ All 6 CLI tests now pass with Fire framework
- ✅ Code passes ruff linting and formatting checks

### ✅ Src Layout Migration
- Moved qtuidoctools package to src/qtuidoctools/
- Updated all this_file paths
- Configured pyproject.toml for src layout
- Updated test and coverage paths

### ✅ Hatch-VCS Setup
- Added hatch-vcs dependency to build system
- Configured git-tag based versioning
- Added version file generation
- Updated __init__.py to use dynamic versioning

### ✅ External Files Integration
- Replaced textutils.py with properly functioning external version
- Replaced keymap_db.py with complete external version
- Fixed Python 3.11+ compatibility issues
- Fixed f-string backslash syntax issues

## Next Iteration Goals

1. ✅ Complete CLI migration from Click to Fire
2. ✅ Ensure all commands work identically  
3. ✅ Update tests to work with Fire
4. **CURRENT**: Move to testing infrastructure setup (Step 5)
