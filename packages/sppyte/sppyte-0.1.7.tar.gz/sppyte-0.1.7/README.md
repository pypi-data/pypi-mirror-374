# Sppyte

A tiny, explicit Python helper for working with SharePoint site in Python using legacy **SharePoint REST** endpoints using and **NTLM** authentication. Sppyte[^1] keeps a very thin abstraction so you can reason about the underlying HTTP calls without surprises.

> ⚠️ This client uses **NTLM** (`requests-ntlm`) and is best suited for **SharePoint on-prem** or environments where NTLM is configured. SharePoint Online typically uses different auth flows.

## Features

- Simple `Site` connection with NTLM auth and automatic **form digest** retrieval.
- `List` helper to:
  - Add / update / delete items
  - Use [OData](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/use-odata-query-operations-in-sharepoint-rest-requests#odata-query-operators-supported-in-the-sharepoint-rest-service) params to control item responses
  - Add **attachments** to items
- `Library` helper to:
  - Add / delete **folders**
  - Upload / download / delete **documents**
  - List folder contents and control output with [OData](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/use-odata-query-operations-in-sharepoint-rest-requests#odata-query-operators-supported-in-the-sharepoint-rest-service) params
- Access other [SharePoint REST service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/get-to-know-the-sharepoint-rest-service) endpoints as needed

## Installation

```console
pip install sppyte
```

## Quickstart

```py
from sppyte import Site

HOST = "https://sharepoint.example.com"
SITE = "/sites/parrots" # relative path
USER = "norweigian"
PASS = "••••••••"

with Site(HOST, SITE, USER, PASS) as site:
    # ---------------- Lists ----------------
    pets = site.list("Pets")

    # Add an item (metadata type is auto-inferred if omitted)
    new_id = pets.add_item({"Title": "Norweigian Blue"})

    # Update the item (uses MERGE)
    patch = {"Title": "Polly"} # Fields to be updated
    pets.update_item(new_id, patch)

    # Attach a file
    with open("notes.txt", "rb") as file_handle: # Read bytes
        pets.add_attachment(new_id, "notes.txt", file_handle)

    # Fetch one item

## Errors

- `SessionError`: raised when an HTTP session isn’t available.
- `ResponseFormatError`: raised when an expected JSON field is missing
  (e.g., FormDigestValue, ListItemEntityTypeFullName, ID, UniqueId).

Handle them as you would any exception:

```py
from sppyte import ResponseFormatError, SessionError

try:
    ...
except (ResponseFormatError, SessionError) as e:
    print("Sppyte error:", e)
```

### Extension methods 

SharePoint REST services endpoints not explicitly implemented can be accessed through the `request` method exposed on `Site`. This methods uses authentication from the current Site session and shadows `requests.request` from the [requests package](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#requests.request), using a [site relative path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/sharepoint?view=graph-rest-1.0#sharepoint-api-root-resources) instead of a complete url.

The `get_form_digest` method is provided to obtain the bearer token passed in the `X-RequestDigest` header for update requests.

List exposes the `get_item_type` method to obtain the required list item type metadata for list updates.

## Notes

- OData Parameters: Methods like get_contents and list_contents accept any OData parameters via params (e.g., $select, $filter, $orderby, $top). See [the docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/use-odata-query-operations-in-sharepoint-rest-requests#odata-query-operators-supported-in-the-sharepoint-rest-service) for supported OData params.
- HTTP request errors are passed through from the requests library unhandled for transparency. See [the docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#errors-and-exceptions) for more information.
- SharePoint limits list response record counts by default. Use the $top OData param for larger response counts.
