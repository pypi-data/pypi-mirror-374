"""
CutML - Comprehensive Unified Traditional Machine Learning

An all-in-one toolkit that automatically runs traditional ML algorithms with 
built-in explainability methods (SHAP, LIME, ELI5) to provide comprehensive
model insights and performance analysis.

Features Coming Soon:
- Auto-run all traditional ML algorithms (RF, XGBoost, SVM, etc.)
- Built-in explainability with SHAP, LIME, ELI5
- Comprehensive model comparison and ranking
- Auto-generated reports with visualizations
- Feature importance analysis across all models
