### Introduction
**VibeChecks** is a lightweight python package that allows users to use natural language (LLMs) as part of their code logic. For example, **VibeChecks** can be used to check if/loop statements as well as provide responses for functions that are described but not implemented. It supports OpenAI and Google Gemini client currently and a simple example illustrating how it can be used can be seen below:
```python
from google import genai
from vibechecks import VibeCheck

# initialize client
client = genai.Client(api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY)

# wrap it in VibeCheck
vc = VibeCheck(client, model="gemini-2.0-flash-lite")

# the example below asks user for a dog breed and checks if it is valid
user_input = input("Enter a dog breed:")
if vc(f"{user_input} is a valid dog breed"):
    print(f"{user_input} is a valid dog breed!")
else:
    print(f"{user_input} is not a valid dog breed!")
```

**VibeChecks** is published on [**pypi**](https://pypi.org/project/vibechecks/) and can be easily installed with:
```bash
python3 -m pip install vibechecks
```
Details on the usage of the package and available APIs can be found on the [**wiki page**](https://github.com/vibe-engineers/vibechecks/wiki).

### Features
- **Natural Language Conditions**: Use natural language to check for conditions, making your code more readable and intuitive.
- **Multi-provider Support**: Seamlessly switch between different LLM providers. VibeChecks currently supports OpenAI and Google Gemini.
- **Extensible**: The modular design allows for easy extension to other LLM providers in the future.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Provides custom exceptions for better error handling and debugging.
