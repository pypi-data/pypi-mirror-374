This is a workaround for https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1367590
It works by creating a path that django_scss will attempt to create
later if it doesn't exist. The django_pyscss code fails
intermittently because of concurrency issues.  This code ignores the
exception and if it was anything other than the concurrency issue
django_pyscss will discover the problem later.

TODO (doug-fish):  remove this workaround once fix for
https://github.com/fusionbox/django-pyscss/issues/23 is picked up.
