ðŸ§® Mathematical Properties and Theoretical Validation Test Suite
===============================================================

This module validates that meta-learning implementations satisfy theoretical
mathematical properties and convergence guarantees from research papers.

Mathematical Properties Tested:
- MAML: Gradient descent properties, second-order gradients, convergence
- Prototypical Networks: Distance metrics, prototype computation, probability simplex
- Statistical Analysis: Confidence intervals, bootstrap properties, significance testing
- Numerical Stability: Gradient boundedness, loss stability, condition numbers

Each test includes:
- Mathematical formulations from original papers
- Theoretical property verification with rigorous validation
- Convergence behavior analysis
- Numerical stability checks under various conditions

Research Papers Validated:
- Finn et al. (2017): MAML theoretical foundations
- Snell et al. (2017): Prototypical Networks mathematical properties
- Statistical literature: Bootstrap and confidence interval theory
- Numerical analysis: Stability and conditioning theory
