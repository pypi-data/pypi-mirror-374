"""
ðŸ“š Research Validation Test Suite
=================================

This module contains tests that validate our meta-learning implementations
against the original research papers to ensure research accuracy.

Test Categories:
- Paper reproduction tests for foundational algorithms
- Mathematical property validation against theoretical claims  
- Hyperparameter consistency with published specifications
- Cross-paper integration and compatibility testing
- Performance characteristic validation

Research Papers Validated:
- Finn et al. (2017): Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)
- Snell et al. (2017): Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning
- Snell et al. (2024): Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally  
- Kirkpatrick et al. (2017): Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting (EWC)
- Vinyals et al. (2016): Matching Networks for One Shot Learning

Each test includes paper citations, mathematical formulations,
and validates that implementations match published specifications.
