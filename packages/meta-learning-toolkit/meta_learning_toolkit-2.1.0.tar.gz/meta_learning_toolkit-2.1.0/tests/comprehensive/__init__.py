"""
ðŸŽ¯ Comprehensive 100% Coverage Test Suite
=========================================

This module contains tests specifically designed to achieve 100% code coverage
by targeting all uncovered code paths while maintaining research accuracy.

Based on coverage analysis showing 82% uncovered code, these tests systematically
target every uncovered line across all modules:

Coverage Targets:
- test_time_compute.py: 90% uncovered â†’ Test all compute strategies, process rewards, TTT
- maml_variants.py: 81% uncovered â†’ Test all MAML variants, advanced features, MAML-en-LLM  
- utils.py: 87% uncovered â†’ Test all utilities, metrics, statistical analysis, curricula
- continual_meta_learning.py: 85% uncovered â†’ Test online learning, EWC, memory banks
- few_shot_learning.py: 7% uncovered â†’ Test advanced components and configurations
- CLI and factory functions: Test all entry points and creation functions

Strategy:
- Systematic testing of all configuration combinations
- Error path testing with proper logging validation  
- Edge case testing for numerical stability
- Integration testing across all components
- Advanced feature testing (uncertainty, adaptation, etc.)

Goal: Achieve 100% test coverage while ensuring every test validates research accuracy.
