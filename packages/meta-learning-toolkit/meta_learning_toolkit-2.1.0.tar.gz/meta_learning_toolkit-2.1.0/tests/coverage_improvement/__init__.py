"""
ðŸ“ˆ Coverage Improvement Test Suite
==================================

This module contains tests specifically designed to achieve 100% code coverage
while maintaining research accuracy and proper error handling.

Tests focus on:
- Uncovered code paths and edge cases
- Configuration validation and error handling  
- Utility functions and factory methods
- Platform-specific and hardware-specific branches
- CLI and entry point functionality

All tests ensure proper error handling with logging - NO SILENT ERRORS allowed.
Every exception path is tested with proper logging verification.
