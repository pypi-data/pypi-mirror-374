This module implements hierarchical prototype structures using:
1. Multi-level prototype hierarchies with Ward linkage clustering
2. Coarse-to-fine prototype refinement based on image processing techniques
3. Tree-based distance measures for prototype similarity
4. Multi-scale prototype networks with different receptive fields
