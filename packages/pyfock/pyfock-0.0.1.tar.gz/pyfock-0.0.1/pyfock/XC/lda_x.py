def lda_x(rho):
    """
    Compute the LDA exchange energy and potential using the Slater exchange functional (spin-unpolarized).

    This is the standard Local Density Approximation (LDA) exchange functional corresponding to 
    `LDA_X` with ID 1 in the LibXC functional library.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rho : ndarray
        Electron density array (assumed to be spin-paired / spin-unpolarized).

    Returns
    -------
    ex : ndarray
        Exchange energy density at each point.

    vx : ndarray
        Exchange potential (functional derivative of exchange energy with respect to density).

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation is based on:
        - Phys. Rev. 81, 385 (1951) â€” the original Slater exchange.

    """
    GPU-accelerated version of the LDA exchange functional using CuPy.

    This is the same as `lda_x` but leverages CuPy for GPU computation. It corresponds to 
    `LDA_X` with ID 1 in LibXC for spin-unpolarized electron density.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rho : cupy.ndarray
        Electron density array (spin-unpolarized), on GPU.

    Returns
    -------
    ex : cupy.ndarray
        Exchange energy density at each point.

    vx : cupy.ndarray
        Exchange potential (functional derivative of exchange energy with respect to density).
