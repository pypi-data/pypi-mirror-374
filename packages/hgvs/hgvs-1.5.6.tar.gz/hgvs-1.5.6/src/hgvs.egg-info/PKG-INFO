           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# *hgvs* - manipulate biological sequence variants according to Human Genome Variation Society recommendations

The *hgvs* package provides a Python library to parse, format, validate,
normalize, and map sequence variants according to [Variation
Nomenclature](http://varnomen.hgvs.org/) (aka Human Genome Variation
Society) recommendations.

Specifically, the hgvs package focuses on the subset of the HGVS
recommendations that precisely describe sequence-level variation
relevant to the application of high-throughput sequencing to clinical
diagnostics. The package does not attempt to cover the full scope of
HGVS recommendations. Please refer to
[issues](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/issues) for limitations.

## Features

- Parsing is based on formal grammar.
- An easy-to-use object model that represents most variant types
  (SNVs, indels, dups, inversions, etc) and concepts (intronic
  offsets, uncertain positions, intervals)
- A variant normalizer that rewrites variants in canonical forms and
  substitutes reference sequences (if reference and transcript
  sequences differ)
- Formatters that generate HGVS strings from internal representations
- Tools to map variants between genome, transcript, and protein
  sequences
- Reliable handling of regions genome-transcript discrepancies
- Pluggable data providers support alternative sources of transcript
  mapping data
- Extensive automated tests, including those for all variant types and
  \"problematic\" transcripts
- Easily installed using remote data sources. Installation with local
  data sources is straightforward and completely obviates network
  access

## Important Notes

- **You are encouraged to** [browse
  issues](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/issues). All known issues
  are listed there. Please report any issues you find.
- **Use a pip package specification to stay within minor releases.**
  For example, `hgvs>=1.5,<1.6`. hgvs uses [Semantic
  Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Installing HGVS Locally

**Important:** For more detailed installation and configuration
instructions, see the [HGVS readthedocs](https://hgvs.readthedocs.io/)

### Prerequisites

    libpq
    python3
    postgresql

Examples for installation:

MacOS :

    brew install libpq
    brew install python3
    brew install postgresql@14

Ubuntu :

    sudo apt install gcc libpq-dev python3-dev

### Installation Steps

By default, hgvs uses remote data sources, which makes
installation easy. If you would like to use local instances of the data sources, see the [readthedocs](https://hgvs.readthedocs.io/).

1. Create a virtual environment using your preferred method.

    **Example:**

        python3 -m venv venv

2. Run the following commands in your virtual environment:

        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install --upgrade setuptools
        pip install hgvs

See [Installation
instructions](http://hgvs.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installation.html)
for details, including instructions for installing [Universal Transcript
Archive (UTA)](https://github.com/biocommons/uta/) and
[SeqRepo](https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo/) locally.

## Examples and Usage

See [examples](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/tree/main/examples) and [readthedocs](https://hgvs.readthedocs.io/) for usage.

## Contributing

The hgvs package is a community effort. Please see
[Contributing](http://hgvs.readthedocs.org/en/stable/contributing.html) to get
started in submitting source code, tests, or documentation. Thanks for getting
involved!

### Testing

Existing tests use a cache that is committed with the repo to ensure that tests do not require external networking.  To develop new tests, which requires loading the cache, you should install UTA and Seqrepo (and the rest service) locally.

    docker compose --project-name biocommons -f $PWD/misc/docker-compose.yml up

IMPORTANT: Loading the test caches is currently hampered b
[#551](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/issues/551),
[#760](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/issues/760), and
[#761](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/issues/761). To load reliably, use
`make test-relearn-iteratively` for now.
