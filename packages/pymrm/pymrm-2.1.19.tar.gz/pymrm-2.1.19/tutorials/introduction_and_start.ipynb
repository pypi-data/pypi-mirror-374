    "In addition to reaction kinetics, transport phenomena like mixing, mass transfer, and heat transfer play a crucial role in determining reactor performance.\n",
    "A reactor model aims to describe these phenomena, serving as a tool for designing and optimizing reactors."

    "## A Typical Transport Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "A common model is the convection-diffusion-reaction equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{v} \\, c - D\\nabla c) = r$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $c$ represents the concentration of a species, but it can also represent multiple species across various phases. The reaction term $r$ may include mass-transfer terms (between phases) in addition to reaction kinetics. The diffusion coefficient $D$ could represent a dispersion coefficient. Similarly, temperature can be modeled using a similar equation. Accumulation terms can be more complex, and counter-flow or other phenomena may also need to be considered."

    "## Discretization of the Reactor Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The convection-diffusion-reaction equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) that needs to be discretized for numerical solutions. The `PyMRM` package provides a set of tools to simplify this process and efficiently solve the resulting equations. Phenomenological models, which are the focus of `PyMRM`, are typically 1D or 2D in space. The discretization is performed on a structured rectilinear grid, represented as a multi-dimensional array. Different species and phases can also correspond to additional dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable efficient computations with these multi-dimensional arrays, `PyMRM` extensively uses `Numpy`. For example, consider a 4-dimensional array where `c.shape = (n_x, n_y, n_p, n_c)`. Here:\n",
    "- The first two axes (`n_x` and `n_y`) correspond to the spatial $x$ and $y$ directions.\n",
    "- The third axis (`n_p`) represents the number of phases.\n",
    "- The fourth axis (`n_c`) represents the number of components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, axis indexing starts at 0, so `axis=2` corresponds to the phases, and `axis=3` corresponds to the components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, solving these equations involves a (partly) implicit approach. For non-linear equations, Newton-Raphson iteration is used. During each iteration, a linear system of equations is solved, represented as a sparse matrix-vector equation. To handle these sparse systems efficiently, `PyMRM` relies on the `SciPy` package, specifically its compressed column format (`csc_array`)."

    "The general transport equation, including reaction, represents a balance of accumulation and transport on the left-hand side, with production or consumption on the right-hand side. The transport term is the divergence of a (molar) flux, which has both convective and diffusive contributions. To explicitly distinguish between the divergence and gradient operators, the equation can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\mathrm{div}(\\mathbf{v} \\, c - D \\, \\mathrm{grad}(c)) = r$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This form is particularly useful because it closely resembles the structure of the discretized equations. For example, in `PyMRM`, the discretized form can be expressed as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(c - c_old) / dt + div_mat @ (conv_mat @ c - D * grad_mat @ c) = r\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- `div_mat` and `grad_mat` are matrices that approximate the differential operators $\\mathrm{div}$ and $\\mathrm{grad}$, respectively.\n",
    "- `conv_mat` is a matrix representing the convective velocities.\n",
    "- `c_old` is the concentration from the previous time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it might seem straightforward to compute convection as `v * c` when `v` is constant, convection is more complex due to numerical stability considerations. This is why specialized operators like `conv_mat` are used in `PyMRM`."
