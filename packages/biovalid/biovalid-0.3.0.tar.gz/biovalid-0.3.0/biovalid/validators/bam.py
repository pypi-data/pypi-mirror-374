"""
Validation function for BAM files.
See: https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf for the BAM file format specification.
This function checks if the BAM file has a valid header and an intact EOF marker.
It does not check the integrity of the BAM file itself.
It is similar to the `samtools quickcheck` command.
