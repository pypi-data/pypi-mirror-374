# cmdmate üöÄ

Your AI-powered terminal assistant that helps you find the right commands, explanations, and even generates git commit messages!

## Features

- **Command Generation**: Get the right terminal commands for any task
- **Explanation Mode**: Ask questions and get detailed explanations
- **Git Commit Helper**: Generate meaningful commit messages from your git diff
- **Cross-platform**: Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Auto OS Detection**: Automatically detects your operating system

## Installation

```bash
pip install cmdmate
```

## Usage

### Basic Command Generation

Generate terminal commands for any task:

```bash
cmdmate "list all files in current directory"
cmdmate "find all python files"
cmdmate "compress folder into zip"
```

### Explanation Mode (`--explain` or `-e`)

Get explanations for anything:

```bash
cmdmate -a "what is docker"
cmdmate --ask "how does git rebase work"
```

### Git Commit Message Generation (`--commitHelp`)

Generate meaningful commit messages from your git diff:

```bash
git diff | cmdmate --commitHelp
git diff --staged | cmdmate --commitHelp
```

Example output:
```
feat: add user authentication with JWT tokens

- Implement login/logout endpoints
- Add JWT token validation middleware
- Create user session management
```

### Specify Target OS (`--os` or `-o`)

Force commands for a specific operating system:

```bash
cmdmate "list files" --os windows
cmdmate "list files" --os linux
cmdmate "list files" -o mac
```

Supported OS aliases:
- `windows`, `win`
- `linux`, `lin`
- `mac`, `darwin`

### Custom Server (`--server`)

Use a custom server endpoint:

```bash
cmdmate "your query" --server http://localhost:8000/
```

## Examples

### Command Generation
```bash
$ cmdmate "find all files larger than 100MB"
find . -type f -size +100M

$ cmdmate "kill process on port 3000"
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
```

### Explanations
```bash
$ cmdmate -e "what does chmod 755 mean"
chmod 755 sets file permissions where:
- 7 (owner): read(4) + write(2) + execute(1) = full permissions
- 5 (group): read(4) + execute(1) = read and execute only
- 5 (others): read(4) + execute(1) = read and execute only
```

### Git Commit Messages
```bash
$ git diff | cmdmate --commitHelp
fix: resolve authentication timeout issue

- Increase JWT token expiration to 24 hours
- Add retry logic for failed auth requests
- Update error handling for expired tokens
```

### Response based on input
```bash
$ cat ReadMe.md | cmdmate "summarize this file for me"
$ git diff | cmdmate "what does the changes do?"
$ cat app.log | cmdmate "can you find any errors in the log file?"
```
