Welcome to the documentation for ``wiggle``,  a tool for fast unbiased angular power spectrum estimation of spin-0 and spin-2 fields on the sphere, most commonly encountered in the context of cosmological data analysis.

.. warning::

   ``wiggle`` has only been tested for spin-0 (scalar) spectra so far. The spin-2 functionality is under active development.
