# Summary

Dark matter halos are fundamental structures in cosmology, forming the gravitational potential wells hosting galaxies and clusters of galaxies.
Their properties and statistical distribution (the halo mass function) are invaluable tools to infer the fundamental properties of the Universe.
The `halox` package is a JAX-powered Python library enabling differentiable and accelerated computations of key iproperties of dark matter halos, and of the halo mass function.


# Statement of need

In cosmology and astrophysics, modeling dark matter halos is central to understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and its formation.
This has motivated the development of many excellent toolkits focused on halo modeling, such as, *e.g.*, halofit [@Smith:2003], halotools [@Hearin:2017], Colossus [@Diemer:2018], or pyCCL [@Chisari:2019].
In parallel, the increasing complexity of cosmological data and astrophysical models, along with the AI-driven advent of novel computational frameworks such as JAX [@Bradbury:2018], have led to the development of differentiable and hardware-accelerated software.
Such software has been published to model fundamental cosmological quantities (*e.g.*, [@Campagne:2023; @Piras:2023]); or various models of dark matter halos physical properties (*e.g.,* [@Hearin:2021; @Hearin:2022; @Alarcon:2023; @Stevanovich:2023; @Keruzore:2024]).

The `halox` package offers a JAX implementation of some widely used properties which, while existing in other libraries focused on halo modeling, do not currently have a publicly available, differentiable and GPU-accelerated implementation, namely:
- Radial profiles of dark matter halos following a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW, [@Navarro:1997; @Lokas:2001]) distribution;
- The halo mass function of @Tinker:2008, quantifying the abundance of dark matter halos in mass and redshift, including its dependence on cosmological parameters;
- The halo bias of @Tinker:2010.
The use of JAX as a backend allows these functions to be compilable and GPU-accelerated, enabling high-performance computations; and automatically differentiable, enabling their efficient use in gradient-based workflows, such as sensitivity analyses, Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo sampling for Bayesian inference, or machine learning-based methods.
