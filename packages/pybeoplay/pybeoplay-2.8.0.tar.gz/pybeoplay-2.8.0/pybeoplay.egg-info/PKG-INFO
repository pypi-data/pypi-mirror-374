# Bang & Olufsen BeoPlay devices Python integration module

Beoplay Python wrapper to integrate B&amp;O speakers/TVs to Python that use the BeoPlay API. BeoPlay API is the 2nd generation B&O API, after [Masterlink Gateway](https://github.com/giachello/mlgw) and before [Mozart](https://github.com/bang-olufsen/mozart-open-api). It is supported by devices built from the early 2000s to the late 2010s, including several BeoVision TV, BeoLab speakers and the NL/ML Converter.

The API is wrapped in an object that can be used  to read the state and control BeoPlay devices. It includes both methods for blocking calls, and async calls with callbacks using aiohttp.
