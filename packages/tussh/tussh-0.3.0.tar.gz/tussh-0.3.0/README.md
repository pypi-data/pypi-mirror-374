# TuSSH

A fast, responsive Textual TUI for browsing and launching SSH hosts from your OpenSSH config.

- Left: searchable host list sorted by usage (most-used first)
- Right: full, merged effective options for the selected host
- Enter connects; `a`/`e`/`d` add/edit/delete; `o` options; `Esc` quits

## Highlights

- Reads `~/.ssh/config` (plus `Include` globs); applies OpenSSH “first match wins”
- Lists only explicit aliases (wildcards still affect merged options)
- Seamless connect flow: the app stays running, suspends the TUI while SSH/Mosh
  runs in your terminal, and resumes the UI after you disconnect
- Theme persistence: pick a theme via Ctrl-P palette; TuSSH saves and restores it
- Add/Edit/Delete host blocks (writes only to primary config)
- Options modal for global extra ssh args and a custom config path
- Choose client: SSH or Mosh (extra SSH args passed to mosh via `--ssh`)
- Filter quickly with `/` (type to filter, `Esc` to leave the filter)
- Usage-based sorting: hosts bubble up as you use them more

## Install

```bash
poetry install
poetry run tussh

# or, after publishing
pip install tussh
tussh
```

## Usage

### Key bindings

- Enter: Connect to highlighted host (also works when pressing Enter in the list)
- `/`: Focus the filter input; type to filter; `Esc` to return to list
- `a`: Add a host
- `e`: Edit selected host
- `d`: Delete selected host (with confirmation)
- `o`: Open Options
- `Esc` or `q`: Quit (also closes an open modal)
- Ctrl-P: Open the palette (pick themes; your choice is saved)

### UI overview

- Host list (left):
  - Sorted by usage (descending), then alphabetically (case-insensitive)
  - First host is selected on startup; the list has focus by default
  - Filter box sits above the list; it does not steal focus unless `/` is pressed

- Options panel (right):
  - Shows the merged, effective options for the selected host
  - Non-focusable to keep keyboard focus in the host list

### Modals

- Options modal:
  - Client: choose SSH or Mosh
  - Extra SSH arguments: appended to every connection (e.g., `-o ConnectTimeout=5`)
  - SSH config path: override the default `~/.ssh/config`
  - `Esc` cancels; `Save` persists to `settings.json`

- Add/Edit host modal:
  - Two-column form: label on the left, input on the right; scrollable content
  - Common fields: Alias, HostName, User, Port, IdentityFile, ProxyJump, ProxyCommand, forwards, keepalives, known hosts file, auth preferences, etc.
  - Booleans: Use OpenSSH-friendly values (yes/no). Examples are shown as placeholders.
  - “Additional options”: free-form lines that will be written verbatim inside the host block
  - `Esc` cancels; `Save` writes to your primary config when possible

## Behavior and storage

- Primary SSH config: defaults to `~/.ssh/config` (override in Options)
- Includes: all `Include` files are read for merging; writes happen only to the primary config
- Safety: if a host lives in an included file or shares a multi-alias block, tussh prevents editing and explains what to do
- Usage-based sorting: each successful connect increments a counter per alias

### Where settings are stored

- Linux: `~/.config/tussh/settings.json`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/tussh/settings.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\tussh\settings.json`

Settings include `extra_args`, `ssh_config_path`, `client`, `usage` counts, and
`theme` (the selected Textual theme name).

## Connecting

- SSH: runs `ssh <alias> [extra args]`
- Mosh: runs `mosh [--ssh="ssh <extra args>"] <alias>`
- The TUI is suspended while the connection runs, so SSH/Mosh owns the TTY.
  The screen is cleared and a brief “Connecting to <alias> …” line is printed.
  When you disconnect, TuSSH resumes instantly without restarting.
  If `suspend` isn’t available in your Textual version, TuSSH falls back to
  the previous behavior and `exec`s the client.

## Troubleshooting

- Enter doesn’t connect:
  - Ensure the host list has focus (press `Esc` to leave the filter)
  - If it still doesn’t work, check your Textual version and report the issue
- `ssh`/`mosh` not found:
  - Install the client and ensure it’s on `PATH`
- Theme not persisting:
  - Open the palette with Ctrl-P, select a theme; the chosen theme name is
    saved to `settings.json` under `theme` and restored at startup
- Can’t edit/delete a host:
  - The host may live in an included file or a multi-alias block; the app will tell you what to change

## Notes

- Writes are confined to the primary SSH config; includes are read-only
- Boolean options are not auto-converted; enter values exactly as you want them written (e.g., yes/no)
- The UI uses a separate stylesheet for layout and modal centering
