Welcome to sl-behavior API documentation page
=============================================

sl-behavior is a Python library that provides tools for processing non-visual behavior data acquired in the
`Sun (NeuroAI) lab <https://neuroai.github.io/sunlab/>`_ at Cornell University.

This library is designed to extract and process the data stored in .npz log files generated by the sl-experiment
library. As part of its runtime, this library generates a set of uncompressed .feather files that store the processed
data until it is integrated in an analysis dataset by the sl-forgery library.

This website only contains the API documentation for the classes and methods offered by this library. See the project
GitHub repository for installation instructions and library usage examples:
