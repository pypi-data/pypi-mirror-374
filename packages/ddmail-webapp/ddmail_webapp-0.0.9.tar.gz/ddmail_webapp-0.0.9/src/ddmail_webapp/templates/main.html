<h2>Main</h2>
<p>E-mail system/service for reasonable paranoid people who value security.</p>
DDMail is a email provider that prioritize security. Unlike many of our
competitors we offer automatic OpenPGP encryption "at rest" for incoming emails
without storing the users private key on our servers.
<p></p>
The project code, all its server configuration and deployment scripts is open
source and can be reviewed and used by anyone. You can use our service or you
can start your own selfhosted ddmail alternative by using our code.
<p></p>
The pricing model do not depend on how many email accounts you have instead you
pay for the total amount of storage independent of how many email accounts,
domains or aliases you use. {% endblock %}
