"""
Echo State Network - Modular Components
======================================

ðŸŒŠ This module contains the modular components for Echo State Network implementation.
Based on: Jaeger (2001) "The 'Echo State' Approach to Analysing and Training Recurrent Neural Networks"

Components:
- esn_core.py: Core ESN class and functionality
- configuration_optimization.py: Hyperparameter optimization and benchmarks
- topology_management.py: Reservoir topology and structure management
- visualization.py: Plotting and analysis tools

ðŸŽ¯ ELI5: Think of this like a LEGO set for building smart memory networks!
Each module is a different type of LEGO piece that helps build networks that can
remember patterns in sequences (like predicting the next word in a sentence).
