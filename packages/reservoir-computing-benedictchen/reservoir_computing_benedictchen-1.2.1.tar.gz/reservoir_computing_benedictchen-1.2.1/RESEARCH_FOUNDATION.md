## Algorithmic Contributions

### Echo State Network Theory
- **Echo State Property**: The reservoir should have a fading memory, where the influence of previous inputs diminishes over time
- **Spectral Radius**: Critical parameter controlling the dynamics of the reservoir; typically set to values less than 1.0
- **Input Scaling**: Controls the nonlinearity of the reservoir dynamics
- **Leak Rate**: Determines the speed of reservoir state updates

### Liquid State Machine Framework
- **Separation Property**: The ability of the liquid (reservoir) to map different inputs to different states
- **Approximation Property**: The readout layer's ability to approximate desired output functions
