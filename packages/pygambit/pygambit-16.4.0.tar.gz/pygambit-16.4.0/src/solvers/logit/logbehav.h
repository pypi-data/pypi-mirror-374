///
/// This is a modified behavior profile class used in the tracing procedure.
/// It assumes that all probabilities are positive; therefore, the log
/// of the probability is well-defined.  Because of this, the realization
/// probability for any node can be computed by taking the sum of the log
/// probabilities of the actions leading up to it, and then exponentiating
/// the sum.
///
/// This means that beliefs can be computed accurately even for information
/// sets for which the information set realization probability is going
/// to zero.  In computing beliefs, for each information set, we find the
/// member reached with maximum probability.  Observe that it must be that
/// this node's realization probability divided by the information set's
/// realization probability must be bounded away from zero.  Beliefs are
/// then computed by subtracting the other nodes' log-realization probability
/// from this "leading" node's log-realization probability, and then
/// exponentiating the result.
///
/// This procedure is significant for this application because it is
/// necessary to accurately compute beliefs for information sets whose
/// realization probabilities are going to zero, so as to be able to
/// get a good approximation to the limiting sequential equilibrium.
