/// @brief Find the roots of a system of polynomials and inequalities, with
///        equal numbers of equations and unknowns, that lie inside a given
///        rectangle.
///
/// The general idea is to first ask whether the Taylor's
/// series information at the center of the rectangle precludes the
/// existence of roots, and if it does not, whether Newton's method leads
/// to a root, and if it does, whether the Taylor's series information at
/// the root precludes the existence of another root.  If the roots in the
/// rectangle are not resolved by these queries, the rectangle is
/// subdivided into 2^d subrectangles, and the process is repeated on
/// each.  This continues until it has been shown that all roots have been
/// found, or a predetermined search depth is reached.  The bound on depth
/// is necessary because the procedure will not terminate if there are
/// singular roots.

/// The list of polynomials must
/// be at least as long as the dimension GetDimension() of the space of the
/// system.  The first GetDimension() polynomials are interpreted as equations,
/// while remaining polynomials are interpreted as inequalities in the
/// sense that the polynomial is required to be non-negative.
