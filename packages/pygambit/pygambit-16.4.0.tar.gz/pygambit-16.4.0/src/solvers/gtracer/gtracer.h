/// @param steps  number of steps to take within a support cell; higher
///               values of this parameter slow GNM down, but may help it
///               avoid getting off the path.
/// @param fuzz   a small floating point cutoff for a variety of things.
///               can probably be left at 1e-12
/// @param LNMFreq  a Local Newton Method subroutine will be run every
///                 LNMFreq steps to decrease accumulated errors.  This
///                 executes fairly quickly, so LNMFreq can be around 3.
/// @param LNMMax   the maximum allowed iterations within the LNM algorithm.
/// @param LambdaMin  should always be negative.  Once the trajectory
///                   gets this far out, the algorithm terminates, under the
///                   assumption there are no more equilibria on the path.

///                   "wobbles" of the perturbation vector to remove
///                   accumulated errors.  This removes the theoretical guarantee
///                   of convergence, but in practice may help keep GNM on the path.

///                   wobbles are disabled, GNM will terminate if the error
///                   reaches this threshold.
