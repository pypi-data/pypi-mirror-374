/// @brief A support on a strategic game
///
/// This class represents a subset of the strategies in strategic game.
/// It is enforced that each player has at least one strategy; thus,
/// the strategies in a support can be viewed as a restriction of a game
/// to a subset of its strategies.  This is useful for eliminating
/// dominated strategies from consideration, and in computational
/// approaches that enumerate possible equilibrium supports.
///
/// Within the support, strategies are maintained in the same order
/// in which they appear in the underlying game.
