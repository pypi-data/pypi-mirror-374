/// This class represents a numerical data value in a game.
///
/// Numerical data in a game (outcome payoffs and chance move probabilities) are
/// stored using instances of this class.  This class accomplishes two objectives:
/// 1.  The canonical representation of a numerical data value is a rational number.
///     This means that algorithms which compute using rational numbers will produce
///     the expected results reliably.
/// 2.  The text representation of a number is recorded.  Therefore, calling code
///     can use either rational numbers or decimals, and this class will recall that
///     representation correctly.  Therefore, "10.1" is represented internally
///     as Rational(101, 100), but the representation "10.1" is returned by the
///     string, and not "101/100".
