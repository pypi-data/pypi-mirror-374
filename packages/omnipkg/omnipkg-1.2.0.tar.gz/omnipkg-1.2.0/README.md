[![💥 Breaking Language Barriers: 24 Languages](https://img.shields.io/badge/💥_Breaking_Language_Barriers-24_Languages-success?logo=babel&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/language_test.yml)

---

`omnipkg` radically simplifies Python dependency management, providing a robust alternative to tools like `pipx`, `uv`, `conda`, and `Docker` for handling conflicting packages. Born from a real-world nightmare—a forced downgrade that wrecked a `conda-forge` environment on a Friday night—`omnipkg` was built in a weekend to solve what others couldn't: running multiple versions of the same package in one environment without conflicts.

---

<!-- COMPARISON_STATS_START -->
## ⚖️ Multi-Version Support

[![omnipkg](https://img.shields.io/badge/omnipkg-58%20Wins-brightgreen?logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/omnipkg_vs_the_world.yml) [![pip](https://img.shields.io/badge/pip-58%20Failures-red?logo=pypi&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/omnipkg_vs_the_world.yml) [![uv](https://img.shields.io/badge/uv-58%20Failures-red?logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/omnipkg_vs_the_world.yml)

*Multi-version installation tests run hourly. [Live results here.](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/omnipkg_vs_the_world.yml)*

---

<!-- COMPARISON_STATS_END -->

## 💡 Why This Matters

**Data Science Reality**: Modern ML projects routinely need multiple TensorFlow versions (legacy models vs. current training), different NumPy versions (compatibility vs. performance), and various PyTorch builds (CPU vs. GPU). Traditional solutions like Docker containers, virtual environments, or complex scripts lead to bloated storage, maintenance headaches, and deployment failures.

**Global Development**: As development teams span continents—from Silicon Valley to São Paulo, Stockholm to Singapore—language barriers shouldn't impede collaboration. Developers working on the same project deserve tools that speak their language, whether debugging in Mandarin, documenting in Spanish, or troubleshooting in Hindi.

**`omnipkg` Solution**: One environment, one script, everything **just works**. Run `torch==2.0.0` and `torch==2.7.1` seamlessly, switch `numpy` versions mid-script, recover from environment damage instantly—all in your native language.

---

## 🧠 Revolutionary Core Features

### 1. Dynamic Version Switching [![💥 Nuclear Test: NumPy+SciPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/💥_Nuclear_Test:NumPy+SciPy-passing-success)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/numpy-scipy-c-extension-test.yml)

Switch package versions mid-script using `omnipkgLoader`, without restarting or changing environments. `omnipkg` seamlessly juggles C-extension packages like `numpy` and `scipy` in the same Python process.

**Example Code:**
```python
from omnipkg.loader import omnipkgLoader
from omnipkg.core import ConfigManager # Recommended for robust path discovery

config = ConfigManager().config # Load your omnipkg config once

with omnipkgLoader("numpy==1.24.3", config=config):
    import numpy
    print(numpy.__version__)  # Outputs: 1.24.3
import numpy # Re-import/reload might be needed if numpy was imported before the 'with' block
print(numpy.__version__)  # Outputs: Original main env version (e.g., 1.26.4)
```

**Key CI Output Excerpts:**
```bash
🤯 NUMPY + SCIPY VERSION MIXING:

🌀 COMBO: numpy==1.24.3 + scipy==1.12.0
🔍 Python path (first 5 entries):
0: /opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.11.13/x64/lib/python3.11/site-packages/.omnipkg_versions/numpy-1.24.3
1: /opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.11.13/x64/lib/python3.11/site-packages/.omnipkg_versions/scipy-1.12.0
🧪 numpy: 1.24.3, scipy: 1.12.0
🎯 Version verification: BOTH PASSED!

🌀 COMBO: numpy==1.26.4 + scipy==1.16.1
🔍 Python path (first 5 entries):
0: /home/runner/work/omnipkg # Back to main environment context
🧪 numpy: 1.26.4, scipy: 1.16.1
🎯 Version verification: BOTH PASSED!

🚨 OMNIPKG SURVIVED NUCLEAR TESTING! 🎇
```

### 2. 🌍 Global Intelligence & AI-Driven Localization [![🤖 AI-Powered: 24 Languages](https://img.shields.io/badge/🤖_AI--Powered-24_Languages-brightgreen?logo=openai&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/language_test.yml)

`omnipkg` eliminates language barriers with advanced AI localization supporting 24+ languages, making package management accessible to developers worldwide in their native language.

**Key Features**: Auto-detection from system locale, competitive AI translation models, context-aware technical term handling, and continuous self-improvement from user feedback.

```bash
# Set language permanently
omnipkg config set language zh_CN
# ✅ Language permanently set to: 中文 (简体)

# Temporary language override
omnipkg --lang es install requests

# Interactive language picker
omnipkg reset-config

# View current configuration
cat ~/.config/omnipkg/config.json
```

Zero setup required—works in your language from first run with graceful fallbacks and clear beta transparency.

### 3. Lightweight Isolation 

Conflicting versions are isolated in lightweight, self-contained "bubbles" containing only necessary files. Compatible dependencies are shared with the main environment, potentially slashing disk space by **up to 60%**.

**Key CI Output Excerpt:**
```bash
🛡️ DOWNGRADE PROTECTION ACTIVATED!
    -> Fixing downgrade: typing_extensions from v4.14.1 to v4.5.0
🫧 Creating isolated bubble for typing_extensions v4.5.0
    📊 Space efficiency: 75.0% saved.
    📝 Created manifest and registered bubble for 1 packages (0.18 MB).
    🔄 Restoring 'typing_extensions' to safe version v4.14.1
✅ Environment protection complete!
```
---

### 4. Downgrade Protection & Conflict Resolution [![🔧 Simple UV Multi-Version Test](https://img.shields.io/badge/🔧_Simple_UV_Multi--Version_Test-passing-success)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/test_uv_install.yml)

`omnipkg` automatically reorders installations and isolates conflicts, preventing environment-breaking downgrades.

**Example: Conflicting `torch` versions:**
```bash
omnipkg install torch==2.0.0 torch==2.7.1
```

**What happens?** `omnipkg` reorders installs to trigger the bubble creation, installs `torch==2.7.1` in the main environment, and isolates `torch==2.0.0` in a lightweight "bubble," sharing compatible dependencies to save space. No virtual environments or containers needed.

```bash
🔄 Reordered: torch==2.7.1, torch==2.0.0
📦 Installing torch==2.7.1... ✅ Done
🛡️ Downgrade detected for torch==2.0.0
🫧 Creating bubble for torch==2.0.0... ✅ Done
🔄 Restoring torch==2.7.1... ✅ Environment secure
```

---

### 5. Python Library, Binary, & C-Extension Support [![⚡ UV Binary Test](https://img.shields.io/badge/⚡_UV_Binary_Test-passing-success)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/test-uv-binary-switching.yml) [![💥 TensorFlow Hot-Swap](https://img.shields.io/badge/💥_TensorFlow_Hot_Swap-passing-success)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/test-tensorflow-switching.yml) [![🧪 Rich Version Juggling](https://img.shields.io/badge/🧪_Rich_Version_Juggling-passing-success)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/rich-module-switching-test.yml)

`omnipkg` seamlessly switches binary tools (e.g., `uv`) and complex C-extension version combinations (e.g., `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `scipy`) during runtime, a feat traditional tools struggle with.

**Key CI Output Excerpts (TensorFlow):**

```bash
🔧 Testing initial state: tensorflow==2.13.0 with typing-extensions==4.14.1 and keras==2.13.1 (main)
TensorFlow version: 2.13.0

### 6. Deep Package Intelligence [![🔍 Package Discovery Demo - Omnipkg Intelligence](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/knowledge_base_check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/knowledge_base_check.yml)

Unlike tools that only track "package installed/not installed," `omnipkg` builds a knowledge base with 60+ metadata fields per package version, stored in Redis for instant analysis.

**Example Insight:**
```bash
omnipkg info uv
📋 KEY DATA for 'uv':
🎯 Active Version: 0.8.11
🫧 Bubbled Versions: 0.8.10

### 7. Instant Environment Recovery 
[![🛡️ UV Revert Test](https://img.shields.io/badge/🛡️_UV_Revert_Test-passing-success)](https://github.com/1minds3t/omnipkg/actions/workflows/test_uv_revert.yml)

If an external tool (like `pip` or `uv`) causes damage, `omnipkg revert` restores your environment to a "last known good" state in seconds.

**Key CI Output Excerpt:**

```bash
Initial uv version (omnipkg-installed):uv 0.8.11
$ uv pip install uv==0.7.13
 - uv==0.8.11
 + uv==0.7.13
uv self-downgraded successfully.
Current uv version (after uv's operation): uv 0.7.13

⚖️  Comparing current environment to the last known good snapshot...
📝 The following actions will be taken to restore the environment:
  - Fix Version: uv==0.8.11
🚀 Starting revert operation...
⚙️ Running pip install for: uv==0.8.11...
      Successfully uninstalled uv-0.7.13
Successfully installed uv-0.8.11
✅ Environment successfully reverted to the last known good state.

--- Verifying UV version after omnipkg revert ---

## 🛠️ Get Started in 60 Seconds

### Step 1: Install and Start Redis (Required)
`omnipkg` uses Redis for fast metadata management. It **must be running** before `omnipkg` is used.

*   **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install redis-server
    sudo systemctl enable redis
    sudo systemctl start redis
    ```

*   **macOS (Homebrew)**:
    ```bash
    brew install redis
    brew services start redis
    ```
    Verify: `redis-cli ping`.

*   **Windows**:
    Use WSL2 (recommended) or Docker:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name some-redis redis
    ```

*   Verify: `redis-cli ping` (should return `PONG`).

### Step 2: Install `omnipkg`
```bash
pip install omnipkg
```

### Step 3: Run the Demo
```bash
omnipkg demo
```
Choose from:
1. Python module switching (`rich`)
2.   Binary switching (`uv`)
3.  C-extension switching (`numpy`, `scipy`)
4.  Complex dependency switching (`tensorflow`)

### Step 4: Try the Stress Test
```bash
omnipkg stress-test
```
Watch `omnipkg` juggle complex `numpy` and `scipy` versions flawlessly!

## 🔬 How It Works (Simplified Flow)

1.  **Install Packages**: Use `omnipkg install uv==0.7.13 uv==0.7.14` or `omnipkg install -r req.txt`
2.  **Conflict Detection**: `omnipkg` spots version clashes and isolates them in bubbles.
3.  **Dynamic Switching**: Use `omnipkgLoader` to switch versions mid-script.
4.  **Redis-Powered Speed**: A high-performance knowledge base is built for all your packages on install at ~9 packages/second.
5.  **Atomic Snapshots**: Instant rollback with `omnipkg revert`.

**Example: Safe Flask-Login Downgrade:**
```bash
omnipkg install flask-login==0.4.1
```
```bash
📸 Taking LIVE pre-installation snapshot...
🛡️ DOWNGRADE PROTECTION ACTIVATED!
-> Detected conflict: flask-login v0.6.3 → v0.4.1
🫧 Creating bubble for flask-login v0.4.1... ✅ Done
🔄 Restoring flask-login v0.6.3... ✅ Environment secure
```

Verify:
```bash
omnipkg info flask-login
```
```bash
📋 flask-login STATUS:
🎯 Active: 0.6.3 (main)
🫧 Available: 0.4.1 (bubble)
📊 Space Saved: 55.5%
```
You now have both versions available in one environment, ready for use anytime!
