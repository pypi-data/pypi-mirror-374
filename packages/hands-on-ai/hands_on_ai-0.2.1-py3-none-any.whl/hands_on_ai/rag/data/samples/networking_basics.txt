The OSI model has 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.
TCP operates at the Transport layer of the OSI model.
IP (Internet Protocol) is responsible for routing packets across networks.
DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses.
Common TCP ports include:
- 80 for HTTP
- 443 for HTTPS
- 25 for SMTP
- 110 for POP3

TCP ensures reliable communication with error correction and flow control.
