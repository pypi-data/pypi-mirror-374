# Sample Notes

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered delivery of data between devices. TCP is part of the TCP/IP suite, which is the set of communications protocols used on the internet. TCP operates at the Transport layer of the OSI model.

## Networking Concepts

- The OSI model has 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
- TCP operates at the Transport layer.
- IP addresses identify devices on a network.
- DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses.

## TCP Features

TCP provides:
- Reliable, ordered delivery
- Error checking
- Flow control and congestion control

## Use Cases

TCP is used in:
- Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)
- File transfers (FTP)
- Remote access (SSH)
