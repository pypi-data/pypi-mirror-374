description: how rovr displays images in the terminal.

`rovr` uses the [`textual-image`](https://github.com/lnqs/textual-image) package to render images directly in the terminal. this allows for a rich file preview experience.

however, image support depends on the capabilities of your terminal emulator. different terminals support different image protocols.

### supported terminals

here is a summary of terminals and their support for the image protocols used by `rovr`:

| terminal           | tgp support | sixel support |
| ------------------ | :---------: | :-----------: |
| black box          |     ❌      |      ✅       |
| foot               |     ❌      |      ✅       |
| gnome terminal     |     ❌      |      ❌       |
| iterm2             |     ❌      |      ✅       |
| kitty              |     ✅      |      ❌       |
| konsole            |     ✅      |      ✅       |
| tmux               |     ❌      |      ✅       |
| visual studio code |     ❌      |      ✅       |
| warp               |     ❌      |      ❌       |
| wezterm            |     ✅      |      ✅       |
| windows console    |     ❌      |      ❌       |
| windows terminal   |     ❌      |      ✅       |
| xterm              |     ❌      |      ✅       |

> the `iterm2 inline images` protocol is not supported. see [lnqs/textual-image #68](https://github.com/lnqs/textual-image/issues/68) for more details.

### configuring the image protocol

if you are using a terminal that doesn't support the default image protocol, `textual-image` will fall back to a `half-cell` representation.

if images do not appear correctly, you can manually override the image protocol in your `config.toml` file.

<Code
  code={`[settings]\nimage_protocol = "Sixel"`}
  lang="toml"
  title="config.toml"
/>

available `image_protocol` values are: `"Auto"`, `"TGP"`, `"Sixel"`, `"Halfcell"`, and `"Unicode"`.
