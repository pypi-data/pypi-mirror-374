description: how to install rovr
---

### requirements

- a patched font that supports nerd font icons
  <br />
  if you dont have any supported fonts, get one from
  [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) for the best
  experience.
  <br />
  if you prefer to not use a nerd font, you will need to disable the nerd font
  in the config
- a python package installer
  <br />
  you are recommended to use `uv`, as it handles everything for you, like
  installing the python version, a lot faster than what `pipx`, or `pip` would
  take
- an editor with toml lsp
  <br />
  only necessary if you want an autocomplete box while configuring rovr.

currently, `rovr` is only on pypi.

#### uv (test run)

```sh
uvx rovr
```

#### uv (install)

```sh
uv tool install rovr
```

#### pipx (install)

```sh
pipx install rovr
```

#### pip (not recommended)

```sh
pip install rovr
```

if successful, you can run

```sh
rovr --version
```

to see the current version installed
