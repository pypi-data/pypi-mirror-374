hi claude, so for my textual file explorer app, how woul i create a test suite? should a virtual file system be used, or a temporary folder that gets removed after testing? how will it check whether the output was intended? how easy is it to add on new tests with that method?

For a textual file explorer app, I'd recommend using **temporary directories** with pytest fixtures. Let me examine your current codebase structure to give you specific recommendations.

Based on your codebase, here's my recommendation for testing a Textual file explorer:

## Testing Strategy

**Use temporary directories** over virtual filesystems. Here's why:

1. **Real filesystem behavior** - Tests actual file operations, permissions, symlinks
2. **Textual compatibility** - Works seamlessly with Textual's file watching and path handling
3. **Simple setup** - Less complex than mocking filesystem operations

## Recommended Setup

```python
# tests/conftest.py
import pytest
import tempfile
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

@pytest.fixture
def temp_fs():
    """Create temporary filesystem with test files"""
    temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()

    # Create test structure
    (Path(temp_dir) / "folder1").mkdir()
    (Path(temp_dir) / "folder2").mkdir()
    (Path(temp_dir) / "file1.txt").write_text("content1")
    (Path(temp_dir) / "folder1" / "nested.py").write_text("print('hello')")

    yield temp_dir

    shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)
```

## Output Verification Methods

1. **Screenshot testing** with `textual.testing.run_pilot`:
```python
async def test_file_list_display(temp_fs):
    app = Application()
    async with app.run_test() as pilot:
        await pilot.app.cd(temp_fs)
        assert "file1.txt" in pilot.app.render()
```

2. **Widget state inspection**:
```python
def test_navigation(temp_fs):
    app = Application()
    app.cd(temp_fs)
    file_list = app.query_one("#file_list")
    assert len(file_list.items) == 3  # 2 folders + 1 file
```

## Ease of Adding Tests

**Very easy** - each test just needs:
```python
def test_delete_file(temp_fs):
    # Setup in fixture
    # Execute action
    # Assert result
```

The temporary directory approach scales well and integrates naturally with your existing codebase structure.
