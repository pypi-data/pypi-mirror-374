# Disabling individual lab extensions

To disable a specific lab extension use `jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab-nbgallery/<extensionname>` such as `jupyter labextension disable @jupyterlab-nbgallery/autodownload`

# Build

Best to build it in a container with JupyterLab installed for the time being. Then:
pip install jupyter_packaging
python setup.py bdist_wheel
