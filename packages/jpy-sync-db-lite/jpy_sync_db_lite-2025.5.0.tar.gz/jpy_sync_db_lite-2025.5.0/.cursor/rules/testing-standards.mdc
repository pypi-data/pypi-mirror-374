- Validate behavior of public APIs only.
- Prefer validation using actual data, interfaces, and objects
- Avoid use of mocks, except where appropriate.
- Target 85% code coverage for all public interfaces and methods.
- Prefer shared helpers for common logic.
- Avoid validation of implementation details and private APIs.
- Prefer validation of patterns of text, and avoid exact matching of content and formatting.
- For Python, prefer pytest, pytest-cov, and pytest-xdist for testing with default parameters of -x -v -n auto.
