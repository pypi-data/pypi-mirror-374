- Follow Research, Plan, and Implement lifecycle.
- Document research in docs/research-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md.
- Document action plans in docs/plan-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md.
- Plans shall detail requirements, acceptance criteria, testing strategy (e.g. TDD and BDD), and a step-by-step implementation guide.
- Implementation lifecycle shall always: code failing tests, then implement code, then run tests, then iteratively refactor and run tests until all tests pass.
- Every feature MUST begin its existence as a standalone library. 
- No feature shall be implemented directly within application code without first being abstracted into a reusable library component.
- Standalone tools and primary libraries must expose their functionality through a CLI. Other libraries may omit a CLI if not appropriate.
- If in doubt, prompt user for clarification and mark as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].
