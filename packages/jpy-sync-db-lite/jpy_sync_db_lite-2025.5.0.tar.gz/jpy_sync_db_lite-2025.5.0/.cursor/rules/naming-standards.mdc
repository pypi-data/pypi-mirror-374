- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g. is_active, has_permission).
- For object definitions and declarations (e.g. class, enum, dataclass), names with acronyms or abbreviations shall be Pascal case like DsvReader, CsvWriter, TransformXmlToJson.
- For SQL, prefer lower case column names.
- Prefer upper snake case for constant names.
