- Prefer line length max of 120 characters, except when to do so would require use of temporary variables
- Except clauses shall be prefixed with a blank line
- Prefer separating logical blocks of code with a blank line for visual clarity
- For Python, for any line continuations, use parentheses only
- For Python, use ruff for code style, linting, and formatting
- Avoid magic strings and magic numbers, instead prefer class level constants, otherwise use module/function level constants.
