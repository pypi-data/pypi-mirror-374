## Package Structure

The package is organized into the following modules:

### `processing`
Functions for data preprocessing, multi-processing of computationally intensive tasks, normalization, imputation, and cleaning. 
Includes tools for handling missing values, scaling, and aggregating omics data.

### `analysis`
Statistical functions and models for downstream analysis. Supports descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, regression models, and more.

### `plotting`
Helper functions for common plotting tasks `matplotlib` and `plotly`. 
Simplifies custom styling, multi-panel figures, and specialized omics visualizations.

### `parsing`
Functions for reading, parsing, and converting glycoproteomics and lipidomics identifiers.

### `utils`
General helper functions for file handling, logging, and other repetitive tasks that donâ€™t fit into other modules.
