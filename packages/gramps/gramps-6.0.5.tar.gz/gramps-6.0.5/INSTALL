This file contains some useful details on the installation from source code
for Gramps. It does not cover installation of a pre-built binary package.
For that use your package manager, the rest is already done by the packager.

Uninstall old version
---------------------
If you do a source install in the same place as an existing install,
you need to remove the old version first. You can delete the old
version by deleting the installed directories. For example, if your installation prefix is /usr/local, remove the following:
        /usr/local/share/gramps
        /usr/local/lib/pythonx.x/site-packages/gramps
        
If you installed with a package manager you might instead need to remove
        /usr/local/lib/pythonx.x/dist-packages/gramps

replacing pythonx.x with the Python version you used, e.g. python3.5.
Also remove any gramps .egg files that are installed along with the Gramps
directory and the file /usr/local/bin/gramps.

If you don't know the list of all files that Gramps installed, you can
reinstall it with the --record option, and take a look at the list this
produces (so python setup.py install --record grampsfiles.txt

Gramps is a Python application, so loading happens on reading the
files, meaning that files of a previous version that are no longer
present in the new version can still be loaded, making the new install
unstable!

Distutils install
-----------------
We do not check all dependencies of Gramps, see README for a list of
all required and optional dependencies. Missing dependencies will
result in runtime errors.

To install all needed dependencies you can use (in Ubuntu):
   sudo apt-get build-dep gramps

To build and install, whether from a tarball or git repo:
   python3 setup.py build
   sudo pip3 install .

You can avoid using sudo for the install step by specifying a prefix to which you have write privilege. The default is /usr/local, which is usually owned by root. You can learn of more options with
   pip3 install --help

One can use Gramps from the command line without installing it by
setting the following environment variables, but that won't provide
things like MIME type and desktop entries.

   export PYTHONPATH="/top/grampsdir/gramps:$PYTHONPATH"
   export GRAMPS_RESOURCES="/top/grampsdir"

See below for ways to invoke Gramps.

Typical install directories in linux (Ubuntu) are:
  * /usr/local/bin                                  : the Gramps executable
  * /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/gramps/ : the Gramps python module
  * /usr/local/share/doc/gramps                     : documentation, also example .gramps and .gedcom
  * /usr/local/share/gramps                         : data files
  * /usr/local/share/gramps/images                  : our images
  * /usr/local/share/gramps/css                     : css files
  * /usr/local/share/icons/hicolor                  : application icons
  * /usr/local/share/locale/xx/LC_MESSAGES          : xx language code, translation
  * /usr/local/share/man/xx/man1                    : xx language code, man file
  * /usr/local/share/applications                   : desktop entry
  * /usr/local/share/mime/packages                  : mime info so Gramps opens files automatically
  * /usr/local/share/metainfo                       : application metadata

Running Gramps
--------------
Gramps is Python only, so no compilation is needed, you can even run Gramps
from the source directory.

 a) You installed Gramps, then you can run it with the command

     gramps

 b) You installed Gramps, and want to start it from the PYTHONPATH. In this
    case use the command:

     python3 -c 'from gramps.grampsapp import main; main()'

   The executable 'gramps' in /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin from a) does
   this for you.

 c) You downloaded the Gramps source code to a directory, and want to run it.
    You can start Gramps from the source code directory with

     python3 Gramps.py

    See gramps/gen/const.py how Gramps finds its resource directories in case
    you encounter problems.

Custom directory installation
-------------------------------------
If you would like to install Gramps without being root, or in an
alternative location on Windows, supply the --root argument to pip3 install

For example:
   pip3 install . --root ~/test

Packager's issues
------------------
There is a MANIFEST.in file to indicate the work needed.
To create a source distribution run:

   python3 setup.py sdist
