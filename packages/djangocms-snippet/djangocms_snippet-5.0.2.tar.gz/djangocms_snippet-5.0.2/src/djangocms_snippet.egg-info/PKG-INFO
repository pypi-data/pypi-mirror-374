==================
django CMS Snippet
==================

|pypi| |coverage| |python| |django| |djangocms| |djangocms4|


**django CMS Snippet** provides a plugin for `django CMS <http://django-cms.org>`_
to inject HTML, CSS or JavaScript snippets into your website.

This project is endorsed by the `django CMS Association <https://www.django-cms.org/en/about-us/>`_. Join us on `Slack <https://www.django-cms.org/slack/>`_.



Warning: We recommend using this plugin only during development::

    This plugin is a potential security hazard, since it allows authorized-
    users to place custom markup or Javascript on pages bypassing all of
    Django's normal sanitization mechanisms. This could be exploited by users
    with the right to add snippets to elevate their privileges to superusers.
    This plugin should only be used during the initial development phase for
    rapid prototyping and testing.

Documentation
=============

See ``REQUIREMENTS`` in the `setup.py <https://github.com/divio/djangocms-snippet/blob/master/setup.py>`_
file for additional dependencies.


Installation
------------

For a manual install:

* run ``pip install djangocms-snippet``
* add ``djangocms_snippet`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
* run ``python manage.py migrate djangocms_snippet``

Djangocms-snippet uses the ace code editor which normally is loaded from a CDN.
If you prefer your application to provide the editor locally, you can change
the requirement from `djangocms_snippet` to `djangocms_snippet[static-ace]` and
add `djangocms_static_ace` to your project's `INSTALLED_APPS`.


Configuration
-------------

To allow the contents of all snippets to be searchable, please set
``DJANGOCMS_SNIPPET_SEARCH`` to ``True`` in your settings::

    DJANGOCMS_SNIPPET_SEARCH = True

We are using `Ace <https://ace.c9.io/#nav=about>`_ as our editor of choice
to edit the snippet content. You can customize the
`theme <https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/tree/master/lib/ace/theme>`_ and
`mode <https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/tree/master/lib/ace/mode>`_ through::

    DJANGOCMS_SNIPPET_THEME = 'github'
    DJANGOCMS_SNIPPET_MODE = 'html'

If dynamic content is inserted (for example ``{% show_menu ... %}``), the plugin cache must be disabled,
please set ``DJANGOCMS_SNIPPET_CACHE`` to ``False`` in your settings::

    DJANGOCMS_SNIPPET_CACHE = False # default value is False

django CMS 4 and later
----------------------

If you use djangocms-versioning or djangocms-moderation, you can have snippets versioned and moderated by
adding the following to your settings::

    DJANGOCMS_SNIPPET_VERSIONING = True  # Set to version with djangocms-versioning
    DJANGOCMS_SNIPPET_MODERATION = True  # Set to moderate with djangocms-moderation

If you enable versioning (e.g., set `DJANGOCMS_SNIPPET_VERSIONING = True`) for djangocms-snippets in a project that already contains snippets, you will need to create `Version` objects for those existing snippets using the `create_version` management command provided by djangocms-versioning.

Template tag
------------

You can also use a template tag to render a snippet rather than a plugin::

    {% load snippet_tags %}
    {% snippet_fragment [reference] %}

Replace ``[reference]`` with either:

* The snippet ID, e.g. ``{% snippet_fragment 42 %}``
* The snippet slug, e.g. ``{% snippet_fragment 'my-snippet' %}``
* The snippet instance, e.g. ``{% snippet_fragment instance.snippet %}``

Optionally provide a fallback if there is no matching id/slug/instance::

    {% snippet_fragment 'my-snippet' or %}
        ... your content fallback here ...
    {% endsnippet_fragment %}


Known Issues
------------

When adding a snippet with the `object` or `embed` tag as root element, the CMS toolbar crashes, making any further
editing of the page difficult or impossible. A workaround is to just put those elements inside a `div` tag.


Running Tests
-------------

You can run tests by executing::

    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
    python setup.py test
