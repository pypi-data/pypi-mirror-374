# MBNpy

## Overview
**MBNpy** is a Python toolkit for **matrix-based Bayesian network (MBN)**--an alternative data structure to conventional BN. MBN is designed to handle **problems with a large number of parent nodes**, where conventional BN tools often fall short. 
Example applications include [transport networks](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2019.01.007) and [pipeline networks](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2021.107468).
