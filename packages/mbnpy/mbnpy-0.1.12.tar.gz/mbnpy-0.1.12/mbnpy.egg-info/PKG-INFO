# MBNpy

## Overview
**MBNpy** is a Python toolkit for **matrix-based Bayesian network (MBN)**--an alternative data structure to conventional BN. MBN is designed to handle **problems with a large number of parent nodes**, where conventional BN tools often fall short. 
Example applications include [transport networks](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2019.01.007) and [pipeline networks](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2021.107468).

If you have need support, refer to the [issues tab](https://github.com/jieunbyun/MBNpy/issues).

## Installation
### Install using pip
MBNpy requires **Python 3.12+**. To install using pip, run:
```bash
pip install mbnpy
```
### Downloading files from GitHub (development version)
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jieunbyun/MBNpy.git
cd MBNpy
```
