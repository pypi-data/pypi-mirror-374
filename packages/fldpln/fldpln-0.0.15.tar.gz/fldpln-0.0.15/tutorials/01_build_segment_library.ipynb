    "\n",
    "The first step to create a FLDPLN library is to identify stream networks from a hydro-conditioned digital elevation model (DEM) and divide the stream networks into segments. The stream networks are first identified using a flow accumulation threshold (i.e., the strfac parameter). The stream networks are then divided into natural reaches (stream links in ArcGIS' term) which are streams between headwater and confluence pixels or between two consecutive confluence pixels. Note that pixels flow out of the DEM are treated as confluence pixels in this process. Those natural reaches are further divided into segments if the flow accumulation along its path jumps greater than or equal to another threshold (i.e., the segfac parameter). Then the segments are bisected until all segments are not longer than a certain length threshold (i.e., the seglen parameter). Note that the units for the flow accumulation thresholds are in squared miles and the unit for segment length is in miles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default values for the 3 parameters (i.e., strfac, segfac and seglen) are: 70 sq. miles, 25 sq. miles, and 2 miles for the libraries in KS. Note that the stream networks of Kansas FLDPLN libraries are more coarse grained than the National Water Model (NWM) reaches. This is because the KS stream networks are generated just to use available USGS gauges. If the NWM discharge is with FDLPLN libraries for the flood inundation mapping, the stream networks should to be densified."
