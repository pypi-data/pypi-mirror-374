âš¡ Qualitative Reasoning - Process Activation Module
=================================================

Process activation and influence application for qualitative reasoning systems.
Extracted from process_engine.py to enforce 800-line limit.

Author: Benedict Chen (benedict@benedictchen.com)
Based on: Forbus, K. D. (1984) - "Qualitative Process Theory"

This module provides process activation logic, influence application,
and causal effect computation for qualitative processes.
