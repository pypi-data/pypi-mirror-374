Factory Function Tests for Modular Qualitative Reasoning System
==============================================================

This module tests the factory functions that create different types
of reasoner instances with appropriate configurations.

Test Coverage:
- Educational reasoner factory
- Research reasoner factory
- Production reasoner factory
- Demo reasoner factory
- Factory function consistency
- Factory customization and differentiation
