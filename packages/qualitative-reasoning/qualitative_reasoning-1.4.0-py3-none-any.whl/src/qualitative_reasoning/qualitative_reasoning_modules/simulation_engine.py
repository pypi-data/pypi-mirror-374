🚀 Qualitative Reasoning - Physics Simulation Engine
====================================================

🎯 ELI5 EXPLANATION:
==================
Think of qualitative simulation like predicting the weather without exact numbers!

Instead of saying "Temperature will be 73.2°F tomorrow," you say "It will be warm and getting warmer." 
Qualitative simulation works exactly this way for any physical system:

1. 🌡️ **Qualitative States**: Instead of exact temperatures, we use "cold," "warm," "hot"
2. 📈 **Trends**: Instead of exact rates, we track "increasing," "decreasing," "steady"  
3. ⏰ **Time Intervals**: Instead of exact times, we use "epochs" where behavior stays consistent
4. 🔄 **Transitions**: We predict when systems change from one state to another
5. 🧠 **Causal Understanding**: We explain WHY things change, not just HOW MUCH

Perfect for: Early design, safety analysis, teaching physics, understanding complex systems!

🔬 RESEARCH FOUNDATION:
======================
Implements foundational qualitative physics frameworks:

🧮 MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES:
==========================

**Quantity Dynamics:**
∂Q/∂t = Σ I±(Q) from active processes

🧠 Qualitative Simulation Theory:
The simulation engine implements the heart of qualitative physics - how physical systems
evolve through qualitative time. Unlike numerical simulation, qualitative simulation:

1. **Temporal Abstraction**: Time is divided into qualitative intervals where system
   behavior is uniform (steady states and transitions)
2. **State Evolution**: System states change through discrete qualitative transitions  
3. **Process-Driven Dynamics**: Changes result from active processes influencing quantities
4. **Causal Reasoning**: Behavior is explained through causal chains of process activation
5. **Predictive Capability**: Future behaviors can be predicted from current trends

🔬 Mathematical Framework:
State Evolution: S(t+1) = Φ(S(t), Active_Processes(t))
Process Activation: Active(P,t) ↔ preconditions(P,t) ∧ quantity_conditions(P,t)  
Quantity Dynamics: ∂Q/∂t = Σ I±(Q) from active processes
Magnitude Transitions: mag(t+1) = transition_function(mag(t), direction(t))
Temporal Progression: sequence of qualitative states over discrete time points

🎯 Core Simulation Engine Capabilities:
- Main qualitative simulation step execution loop
- Quantity magnitude evolution through qualitative transitions
- State transition logic with landmark value handling  
- Future state prediction algorithms
- State history management and temporal reasoning

🌟 Key Implementation Features:
- Robust qualitative magnitude transition algorithms

🔧 Integration:
This mixin integrates with:
- Core types for qualitative values and states
- Constraint engine for system consistency
- Process engine for causal influences
- Main reasoner for system coordination

🚀 Simulation Loop Architecture:
1. **Process Evaluation**: Determine which processes are active
2. **Influence Application**: Apply process influences to quantity directions  
3. **Magnitude Evolution**: Update quantity magnitudes based on directions
4. **Constraint Checking**: Verify system consistency

    🧠 Core Simulation Concepts:
    
    **Qualitative Time**: Unlike continuous numerical time, qualitative time consists
    of discrete intervals where system behavior is uniform. Transitions occur when
    quantities cross landmark values or process conditions change.
    
    **State Evolution**: The system progresses through a sequence of qualitative
    states, each representing a distinct behavioral regime. The simulation engine
    computes these transitions based on active processes and their influences.
    
    **Magnitude Transitions**: Quantities evolve through discrete qualitative
    magnitudes (negative_large → negative_small → zero → positive_small, etc.)
    based on their directions and the influences from active processes.
    
    **Temporal Prediction**: By understanding current process activations and
    trends, the engine can predict likely future qualitative behaviors without
    requiring precise numerical integration.
