‚öôÔ∏è Qualitative Reasoning - Process Engine Module (Refactored)
=============================================================

Refactored from original 1,087-line monolith to modular 4-file architecture.
Now imports from specialized modules to meet 800-line standard.

Author: Benedict Chen (benedict@benedictchen.com)
Based on: Forbus, K. D. (1984) - "Qualitative Process Theory"

Modular implementation of qualitative process theory

Modules:
- process_management.py - Process creation, configuration, dependencies
- process_conditions.py - Secure condition evaluation, quantity comparisons
- process_activation.py - Process activation, influence application  
- process_causal_reasoning.py - Causal explanation, behavioral analysis

This file serves as backward compatibility wrapper while the system migrates
to the new modular architecture.

    Process Engine Mixin for Qualitative Reasoning Systems
    
    ELI5: This is like having a super-smart cause-and-effect system! It can 
    figure out which processes should be running, how they affect each other,
    and explain why things are happening in your system.
    
    Technical Overview:
    ==================
    Implements comprehensive process management as required by Forbus's 
    Qualitative Process Theory. This combines:
    
    - Process creation and dependency management
    - Secure condition evaluation without eval() vulnerabilities
    - Dynamic process activation and influence application
    - Rich causal explanation and behavioral analysis
    
    The core challenge is implementing the causal mechanisms that drive 
    qualitative system behavior while maintaining computational efficiency
    and explanation capability.
    
    Modular Architecture:
    ====================
    This class inherits from specialized mixins:
    
    1. **ProcessManagementMixin**: Process creation and configuration
       - Process definition with preconditions and influences
       - Dependency analysis and conflict detection
       - Causal graph construction and management
    
    2. **ProcessConditionsMixin**: Secure condition evaluation
       - Safe parsing of logical and quantity conditions
       - Whitelist-based evaluation without eval() vulnerabilities
       - Support for complex logical expressions and comparisons
    
    3. **ProcessActivationMixin**: Dynamic process activation
       - Process activation cycle based on current conditions
       - Influence application with conflict resolution strategies
       - Activation history tracking and statistics
    
    4. **ProcessCausalReasoningMixin**: Causal explanation and analysis
       - Rich behavioral explanations for quantity changes
       - Causal chain construction and feedback loop detection
       - System-wide causal pattern analysis
    
    Theoretical Foundation:
    ======================
    Based on Forbus's Qualitative Process Theory:
    - **Process Ontology**: Physical behavior emerges from active processes
    - **Causal Influences**: Processes affect quantities through I+/I- relations  
    - **Temporal Dynamics**: Process activation creates system evolution
    - **Explanation**: Behavior explained through process activation chains
    
    Configuration Requirements:
    ==========================
    The implementing class must provide:
    - self.quantities: Dict of QualitativeQuantity objects
    - self.connections: Optional connection topology for objects
    - self.objects: Optional object registry for existence checks
    - self.flags: Optional boolean flags for simple conditions
    
    Performance Characteristics:
    ===========================
    ‚Ä¢ Process Management: O(n) for addition, O(n¬≤) for dependency analysis
    ‚Ä¢ Condition Evaluation: O(k) where k is condition complexity
    ‚Ä¢ Activation Cycle: O(n*k) where n=processes, k=avg conditions per process
    ‚Ä¢ Causal Analysis: O(n*d) where d is maximum causal depth
    ‚Ä¢ Memory Usage: O(n) for processes + O(h) for activation history
