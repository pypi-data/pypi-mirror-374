# About PTO (Planner of Transit Observations):
`PTO` is a code that allows the user to calculate transit windows and plot their visibility for given location. Currently, main focus of `PTO` is handling high-resolution observations of transits, but further extensions can be made.

The main capabilities of `PTO` are:

1. Load NASA Exoplanet archive table using TAP service
2. Filter targets based on common characteristics
3. Calculate positions of transit windows
4. Calculate the visibility of each transit windows

Please read the documentation at [https://pto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://pto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The developement has been moved from GitHub to GitLab to [https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/pto](https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/pto). Please post any issues there. Both repositories are updated regularly.

For any bug/ feature requests, please open an issue on the GitLab page [https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/pto](https://gitlab.unige.ch/spice_dune/pto).

To get started, please read the notebook at [https://pto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Get_started.html](https://pto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Get_started.html).
The tutorial will be merged in a single example notebook soon.

A general outline of usage is shown below:
