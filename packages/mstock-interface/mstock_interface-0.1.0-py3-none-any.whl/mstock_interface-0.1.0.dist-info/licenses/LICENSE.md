2.4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

3. Distribution Obligations

3.1. Application of this License
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code Form of the Covered Software You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code Form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder.

3.2. Distribution of Source Form
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.

3.3. Distribution of Executable Form
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form, You must:
    a. make the Source Code Form of the Covered Software available to recipients and provide an appropriate notice stating the Executable Form is governed by this License and listing the means by which the recipients may obtain a copy of the Source Code Form; and
    b. inform recipients of the Executable Form of the Covered Software that a copy of the License is available at the location described in the notice.

3.4. Exclusions from Distribution Obligations
The distribution obligations in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3 do not apply to any Source Code Form that is:
    a. Incompatible With Secondary Licenses; or
    b. a Larger Work.

3.5. Notice of Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

4. Versions of the License

4.1. New Versions
Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Mozilla Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

4.2. Effect of New Versions
You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.

4.3. Permissive Compatibility
If You distribute Covered Software under the terms of a subsequent version of this License, You may also distribute the Covered Software under the terms of any Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) automatically and prospectively, unless the Contributor has previously terminated Your rights under this License, in which case the Contributor may, at its sole discretion, reinstate Your rights; or (b) upon written notice from the Contributor.

5.2. If You institute litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Covered Software (including Modifications made by that entity) infringes a patent, then any patent licenses granted to You by that entity under this License shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

5.3. All sublicenses to the Covered Software which are properly granted prior to termination of this License shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted by this License, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

9. Governing Law

This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the license steward is located, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions.
