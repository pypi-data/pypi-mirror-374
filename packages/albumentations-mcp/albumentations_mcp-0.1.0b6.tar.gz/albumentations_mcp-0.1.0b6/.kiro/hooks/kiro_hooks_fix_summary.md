# Kiro Hooks Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Complex Trigger Patterns**

**Problem**: Many hooks had complex trigger patterns with multiple file types and unsupported trigger types like `afterTaskCompletion`, `beforeCommit`, `taskStatusChanged`, etc.

**Fix**: Simplified to basic supported triggers:

- `manual` (always works)
- `fileCreated` with simple patterns
- `fileSaved` with simple patterns

### 2. **Overly Long Prompts**

**Problem**: Hook prompts were extremely long with detailed formatting instructions that might cause parsing issues.

**Fix**: Shortened all prompts to concise, actionable messages with emoji indicators for easy identification.

### 3. **Version Conflicts**

**Problem**: Some hooks had version conflicts or inconsistent versioning.

**Fix**: Updated all hooks to consistent version numbers (v3 for updated hooks, v1 for new ones).

### 4. **JSON Formatting Issues**

**Problem**: While JSON was valid, some complex nested structures might cause parsing issues.

**Fix**: Simplified JSON structure with minimal nesting and clear formatting.

## Updated Hooks

### Core Functionality Hooks

1. **test-hook.kiro.hook** - Simple test to verify hook system works
2. **check-existing-implementation.kiro.hook** - Check for duplicate code before creating new
3. **pre-implementation-check.kiro.hook** - Analysis before coding
4. **post-implementation-review.kiro.hook** - Review after coding

### Quality Assurance Hooks

5. **code-quality-check.kiro.hook** - Run linting and type checking
6. **function-code-review.kiro.hook** - Senior-level function review
7. **code-refactoring-review.kiro.hook** - Refactoring opportunities

### Security & Documentation Hooks

8. **regex-security-check.kiro.hook** - Check for ReDoS vulnerabilities
9. **create-regex-analysis.kiro.hook** - Generate comprehensive regex analysis
10. **file-summary-todo.kiro.hook** - Planning before file creation

### Project Management Hooks

11. **task-completion-commit.kiro.hook** - Generate git commit messages

## Key Changes Made

### Simplified Trigger Patterns

```json
// Before (complex)
{
  "type": "fileEdited",
  "patterns": ["src/**/*.py", "tests/**/*.py", "*.py"]
}

// After (simple)
{
  "type": "fileSaved",
  "patterns": ["src/**/*.py"]
}
```

### Shortened Prompts

```json
// Before (verbose)
"prompt": "A function has been written or modified in the codebase. Please perform a thorough code review as a senior engineer would, focusing on:\n\n1. **Bad Practices**: Check for anti-patterns..."

// After (concise)
"prompt": "👨‍💻 FUNCTION REVIEW: Function modified. Senior review for: 1) Bad practices/anti-patterns 2) Overengineering..."
```

### Added Emoji Indicators

Each hook now has a unique emoji to make it easy to identify which hook triggered:

- 🎉 Test Hook
- 🔍 Implementation Check
- 📋 Pre-Implementation
- ✅ Post-Implementation
- 🔧 Quality Check
- 👨‍💻 Function Review
- 🔄 Refactoring Review
- 🚨 Security Check
- 📊 Regex Analysis
- 📝 File Planning
- 📝 Commit Message

## Testing the Hooks

1. **Manual Test**: Try the "Test Hook" manually to verify the system works
2. **File Save Test**: Save a Python file in `src/` to trigger quality and security checks
3. **Manual Reviews**: Use the manual hooks for code reviews and analysis

## Next Steps

1. **Test the simplified hooks** - Try the test hook first
2. **Monitor hook execution** - Check if hooks are now triggering properly
3. **Adjust patterns if needed** - If some hooks still don't work, we can further simplify
4. **Add more hooks** - Once working, we can add more specialized hooks

The hooks should now work much more reliably with Kiro's hook system!
