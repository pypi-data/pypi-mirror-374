# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The albumentations-mcp tool is an MCP-compliant image augmentation system that accepts natural language commands and applies corresponding image transformations using the Albumentations Python library. The tool features a comprehensive hook system for extensibility, developer tooling integration, and structured output generation. This system enables users to describe desired image augmentations in plain English and receive professionally augmented images with full transformation metadata.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to provide natural language commands for image augmentation, so that I can easily apply complex transformations without knowing specific API parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a natural language prompt like "Add motion blur and increase contrast" THEN the system SHALL parse the prompt into structured transformation parameters
2. WHEN a user uploads an image file THEN the system SHALL accept common image formats (PNG, JPEG, WEBP, TIFF)
3. WHEN the parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a valid JSON specification for Albumentations transforms
4. IF the natural language prompt is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL use reasonable default parameters for the requested transformations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want MCP-compliant functionality, so that the tool integrates seamlessly with Claude Desktop, Kiro, and other MCP-compatible systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool receives an MCP request THEN it SHALL respond with valid MCP protocol messages
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL maintain MCP message structure and formatting
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return MCP-compliant error responses
4. WHEN successful THEN the system SHALL return results in the expected MCP response format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a comprehensive hook system, so that I can customize and extend the augmentation pipeline at key stages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

6. WHEN transformation completes THEN it SHALL trigger the post_transform_classify hook for classification consistency
7. WHEN saving begins THEN it SHALL trigger the pre_save hook for filename modification
8. WHEN saving completes THEN it SHALL trigger the post_save hook for follow-up actions
9. WHEN any hook fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing unless the hook is marked as critical

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want integrated quality tools, so that code quality is maintained automatically throughout the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL create a timestamped log entry with operation details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want a clean project structure, so that the codebase is maintainable and components are properly separated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN MCP logic SHALL be separated into dedicated modules
2. WHEN the project is structured THEN hook system SHALL be in isolated, pluggable modules

1. WHEN an image is processed THEN the system SHALL apply transformations using the Albumentations library
2. WHEN transformations are applied THEN the system SHALL preserve image quality where possible
3. WHEN invalid parameters are detected THEN the system SHALL use safe fallback values
4. WHEN transformation fails THEN the system SHALL return the original image with error metadata
5. WHEN multiple transforms are requested THEN the system SHALL apply them in a logical sequence

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual verification of augmentations, so that I can confirm the intended transformations were successfully applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image transformation completes THEN the system SHALL trigger the post_transform_verify hook
2. WHEN the verify hook runs THEN it SHALL analyze both original and augmented images using a vision-capable model
3. WHEN visual analysis completes THEN it SHALL generate a confidence score from 1-5 for transformation success
4. WHEN visual analysis completes THEN it SHALL provide a brief explanation of observed changes
5. WHEN verification completes THEN it SHALL save results as visual_eval.md in the output directory
6. IF the vision model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want classification consistency checking, so that I can understand if augmentations affect downstream ML model performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image transformation completes THEN the system SHALL trigger the post_transform_classify hook
