- ✅ **FIXED:** Similar validation logic - server.py uses centralized `validate_string_input`, `validate_numeric_range`
- ✅ **FIXED:** Restructured `image_utils.py` → `image_conversions.py` + `utils/image_handler.py`
- **Impact:** Eliminated maintenance burden and inconsistency
- **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**
