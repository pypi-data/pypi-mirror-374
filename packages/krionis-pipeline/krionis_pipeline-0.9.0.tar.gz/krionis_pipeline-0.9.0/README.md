# Krionis â€” The Local AI Knowledge Engine with Agents at its Core

**Krionis** is a fully local, GPU-poor, multimodal **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** ecosystem built for **local-first environments â€” from enterprise knowledge bases to operational technology systems**.  
It provides AI-assisted access to technical knowledge, manuals, and historical data â€” securely, offline, and at minimal cost.

This monorepo contains **two independently published PyPI packages**:

| Package | PyPI | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| [`krionis-pipeline`](https://pypi.org/project/krionis-pipeline/) | Core multimodal RAG pipeline (retrieval, rerank, compression, generation). |
| [`krionis-orchestrator`](https://pypi.org/project/krionis-orchestrator/) | Orchestration runtime for batching, multi-agent workflows, and coordination. |
| [`rag-llm-api-pipeline`](https://pypi.org/project/rag-llm-api-pipeline/) | Compatibility shim that depends on `krionis-pipeline` (imports still work). |

## âœ¨ Why Krionis?

- **Local-first**: Designed for CPU/GPU-poor environments.  
- **Secure**: Air-gapped operation, no external dependencies once models are downloaded.  
- **Modular**: Pipeline provides core RAG functions; Orchestrator adds agent runtime + batching.  
- **Compatible**: Old imports (`import rag_llm_api_pipeline`) and CLI (`rag-cli`) still work.

## ðŸ“¦ Components

### ðŸ”¹ Krionis Pipeline
- Vector search with FAISS/HNSW + SentenceTransformers embeddings.  
- HuggingFace LLM integration (Qwen, Mistral, LLaMA, etc.).  
- Mixed precision (fp32, fp16, bfloat16) with YAML-based device/precision switching.  
- Multimodal input: text, PDFs, images (OCR), audio, video.  
- Interfaces:  
  - CLI (`rag-cli`, `krionis-cli`)  
  - FastAPI REST API  
  - Lightweight Web UI  


---

### ðŸ”¹ Krionis Orchestrator
- Microbatching & gatekeeper queue for efficient, low-latency queries.  
- Agent runtime with built-ins. 
- REST API + Web UI for monitoring and interaction.

## Quickstart

### Required Setup

Before starting the orchestrator, always make sure your working directory contains:

- **`config\system.yaml`** â€“ the main configuration file used by both the orchestrator and the pipeline.  
- **`data\manual\`** â€“ a directory with manually curated data (shared by both the pipeline and orchestrator).

These must be present in the directory where you launch the CLI (`pwd` on Linux/macOS, current folder in Windows).

Install pipeline:

```bash
pip install krionis-pipeline
```
### Krionis Orchestrator CLI

The orchestrator ships with a cross-platform CLI, installed as `krionis-orchestrator`.  
It lets you start, stop, restart, and inspect the orchestrator.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start the orchestrator (detached in background)
krionis-orchestrator start --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# Check if it's running
krionis-orchestrator status
# â†’ Running (pid 12345, uptime 00:02:17).

# Stop the orchestrator
krionis-orchestrator stop

# Restart the orchestrator
krionis-orchestrator restart
```

### Options

	--host (default: 0.0.0.0) â€“ bind address
	--port (default: 8080) â€“ port to serve on
	--workers (default: 1) â€“ number of uvicorn workers
	--log-file â€“ optional path to capture logs

### Developer Mode

To run in the foreground with hot-reload (auto-restart on code changes):
```bash
krionis-orchestrator dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```
## The CLI works the same on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
