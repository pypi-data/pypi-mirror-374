# Em-Md

_tools for processing markdown files & projects with python & CLI_

## Features

- **Local Links Processor**  
  Rewrite Markdown links and embedded media paths in all markdown files in the directory specified with the `--root` option:
  - `--mode to-absolute`: convert relative links into root-absolute links (relative to your project root).
  - `--mode to-relative`: convert absolute links (that point to existing files within the project) back into relative paths.
  - Supports inline links/images, reference-style links, and HTML embeds (`<img>`, `<a>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<source>`).
  - Skips code blocks and inline code to avoid accidental rewrites.
  - Flexible output: root-absolute (`/path/file.md`), `file:///` URLs, or URLs with a base (e.g. `https://example.com/...`).
  - CLI with dry-run (`--print-changes`), in-place rewrite (`--write`), and automatic backups (`--backup`).

This is just the first tool â€” more Markdown utilities will be added to the **Em-Md toolbox** over time.

## Quickstart

Install on local machine:

```bash
pip install em-md
```

Run the **local links** processor on your project:

```bash
em-md-change-links \
  --root . \
  --glob "**/*.md" \
  --mode to-absolute \
  --print-changes
```

Apply changes in place (with backups):

```bash
em-md-change-links \
  --root . \
  --glob "**/*.md" \
  --mode to-absolute \
  --write --backup
```

Convert absolute paths back to relative paths:

```bash
em-md-change-links \
  --root . \
  --glob "**/*.md" \
  --mode to-relative \
  --write
```

## Roadmap

* Extend `local_links` with smarter path handling for cross-project references.
* Add more Markdown processing tools:

  * frontmatter manager
  * heading/link normalizer
  * link checker / validator
* Provide `em-md` as an installable CLI entrypoint (`pip install em-md`).
* Package docs with worked examples and best practices.
