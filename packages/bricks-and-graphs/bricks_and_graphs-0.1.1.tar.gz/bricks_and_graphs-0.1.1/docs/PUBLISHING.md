# Publishing to PyPI

This document describes how to publish the `bricks-and-graphs` package to PyPI using GitHub Actions.

## Overview

We use GitHub Actions for automated publishing to PyPI with the following features:

- **API Token Authentication**: Uses PyPI API tokens stored as GitHub secrets
- **Automatic Release Publishing**: Triggered when you create a GitHub release
- **Manual Publishing**: Can be triggered manually for testing

## Prerequisites

### 1. PyPI Account Setup

1. Create an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/account/register/)
2. Verify your email address

### 2. PyPI API Token Setup

**Get PyPI API Token**:
- Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
- Click "Add API token"
- Name: `bricks-and-graphs-github-actions`
- Scope: "Entire account" (or specific to your project once it exists)
- Copy the token (starts with `pypi-`)

### 3. GitHub Secrets Setup

Add the API token as a GitHub repository secret:

1. Go to your repository â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add this secret:
   - **Name**: `PYPI_API_TOKEN`, **Value**: Your PyPI API token

## Publishing Process

### 1. Automatic Publishing (Recommended)

The easiest way to publish is through GitHub releases:

1. **Update Version**: Update the version in `pyproject.toml`
   ```toml
   [project]
   version = "0.2.0"  # Update this
   ```

2. **Commit and Push**:
   ```bash
   git add pyproject.toml
   git commit -m "ðŸ”– Bump version to 0.2.0"
   git push
   ```

3. **Create GitHub Release**:
   - Go to your repository â†’ Releases â†’ Create a new release
   - Tag: `v0.2.0` (must match the version in pyproject.toml)
   - Title: `Release v0.2.0`
   - Description: Add release notes describing changes
   - Click "Publish release"

4. **Automatic Workflow**: The publish workflow will automatically:
   - Run all tests
   - Run linting
   - Build the package
   - Publish to PyPI
   - Attach build artifacts to the release

### 2. Manual Publishing

For testing or emergency releases:

- Go to Actions â†’ Publish to PyPI â†’ Run workflow
- Click "Run workflow"

### 3. Testing Package Installation

After publishing, test the installation:

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install bricks-and-graphs

# Test basic functionality
python -c "import bag; print('âœ… Package installed successfully')"
```

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Pre-release Versions

For testing, you can use pre-release versions:

- **Alpha**: `1.0.0a1`, `1.0.0a2`, etc.
- **Beta**: `1.0.0b1`, `1.0.0b2`, etc.
- **Release Candidate**: `1.0.0rc1`, `1.0.0rc2`, etc.

Example workflow for pre-release:
1. Update version to `0.2.0a1` in `pyproject.toml`
2. Create release with tag `v0.2.0a1`
3. Test installation and functionality
4. Update to `0.2.0` when ready for production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"File already exists" error**:
   - You're trying to upload a version that already exists
   - Update the version number in `pyproject.toml`

2. **Authentication failed**:
   - Check that your API token is correctly set in GitHub secrets
   - Verify the secret name matches exactly (`PYPI_API_TOKEN`)
   - Make sure the API token hasn't expired

3. **Build failures**:
   - Check that all tests pass locally
   - Ensure pre-commit hooks pass
   - Verify the package builds locally: `uv build`

4. **Import errors after installation**:
   - Check that all dependencies are properly declared
   - Test the package in a clean environment

### Local Testing

Before publishing, always test locally:

```bash
# Build the package
uv build

# Check the package
uv run twine check dist/*

# Test in a clean environment
python -m venv test_env
source test_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: test_env\Scripts\activate
pip install dist/*.whl
python -c "import bag; print('Success!')"
```

## Security Notes

- **Never commit API keys** to the repository
- **Store API token as GitHub secrets** only
- **Use scoped API token** when possible (project-specific rather than account-wide)
- **Only publish from the main branch** for production releases
- **Review all changes** before creating releases
- **Rotate API token** periodically for security
