# PyPI Packaging Analysis and Fixes

## Analysis Summary

I analyzed the PyPI packaging configuration for the Escobar JupyterLab extension and identified several issues with asset inclusion. Here's what was found and fixed:

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Static Assets in Package
- **Problem**: The `static/oauth-callback.html` file was not being included in the PyPI package
- **Impact**: Google OAuth authentication would fail when the extension is installed via pip
- **Root Cause**: The `package.json` files array didn't include the `static/**/*` directory

### 2. Icon Files Not Explicitly Included
- **Problem**: While icons are embedded as SVG strings in TypeScript files, the standalone SVG files weren't included
- **Impact**: Potential issues if the build process changes or if SVG files are referenced directly
- **Root Cause**: Missing `src/icons/*.svg` in the package.json files array

### 3. Handler Code Couldn't Find Static Files in Installed Package
- **Problem**: The `OAuthCallbackHandler` was looking for static files using relative paths that don't work when the package is installed via pip
- **Impact**: OAuth callback would return 404 errors in production installations
- **Root Cause**: Handler code wasn't using `pkg_resources` to access packaged files

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated package.json Files Array
**File**: `package.json`

```json
"files": [
  "lib/**/*.{d.ts,eot,gif,html,jpg,js,js.map,json,png,svg,woff2,ttf}",
  "style/**/*.{css,js,eot,gif,html,jpg,json,png,svg,woff2,ttf}",
  "schema/*.json",
  "static/**/*",           // ← Added: Include all static files
  "src/icons/*.svg"        // ← Added: Include standalone SVG icons
]
```

### 2. Updated pyproject.toml Shared Data
**File**: `pyproject.toml`

```toml
[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.shared-data]
"escobar/labextension" = "share/jupyter/labextensions/escobar"
"install.json" = "share/jupyter/labextensions/escobar/install.json"
"static" = "share/jupyter/labextensions/escobar/static"  # ← Added: Include static directory
```

### 3. Fixed Handler Code for Package Resource Access
**File**: `escobar/handlers.py`

Updated the `OAuthCallbackHandler` to:
1. First try to load the OAuth callback HTML from the installed package using `pkg_resources`
2. Fall back to file system path for development environments
3. Use the correct path: `labextension/static/oauth-callback.html` (where the static files are actually installed)

```python
# Try to get the file from the installed package first
try:
    # This works when the package is installed via pip
    # The static files are installed in the labextension directory
    callback_content = pkg_resources.resource_string('escobar', 'labextension/static/oauth-callback.html').decode('utf-8')
    # ... serve from package
except (ImportError, FileNotFoundError, OSError):
    # Fallback to file system path for development
    # ... serve from file system
```

## Verification

### Test Script Created
**File**: `test_package_contents.py`

Created a comprehensive test script that:
1. Builds the package using `python -m build`
2. Examines the wheel (.whl) contents
3. Examines the source distribution (.tar.gz) contents
4. Verifies that critical files are included:
   - `static/oauth-callback.html` (for Google auth)
   - `schema/plugin.json` (for JupyterLab settings)
   - Icon files (compiled into JavaScript bundles)
   - JupyterLab extension files

### Test Results
The test confirmed that:
- ✅ OAuth callback HTML is now properly included in the wheel
- ✅ Static files are accessible at the correct path in the installed package
- ✅ Schema files are included in the source distribution
- ✅ Icon files are compiled into the JavaScript bundles (as expected)

## Critical Files Now Included

### In Wheel Package:
- `escobar/labextension/static/oauth-callback.html` - OAuth callback for Google authentication
- `escobar/labextension/schemas/escobar/plugin.json` - JupyterLab extension schema
- `escobar/labextension/static/style.js` - Compiled extension styles and assets
- All compiled JavaScript bundles containing the icon definitions

### In Source Distribution:
- `static/oauth-callback.html` - Source OAuth callback file
- `schema/plugin.json` - Source schema file
- `src/icons/*.ts` - TypeScript icon definitions
- `src/icons/*.svg` - Standalone SVG icon files

## Impact

These fixes ensure that:

1. **Google OAuth authentication works** when the extension is installed via pip
2. **JupyterLab settings and shortcuts work** properly with the included schema
3. **Icons display correctly** in the JupyterLab interface
4. **The extension functions identically** whether installed from source or PyPI

## Recommendations

1. **Run the test script** before each PyPI release:
   ```bash
   python test_package_contents.py
   ```

2. **Test OAuth functionality** in a clean environment after installing from PyPI

3. **Consider automating** the package content verification in CI/CD pipeline

4. **Monitor** for any new static assets that might need to be added to the packaging configuration

## Files Modified

1. `package.json` - Updated files array to include static assets
2. `pyproject.toml` - Added static directory to shared-data
3. `escobar/handlers.py` - Fixed OAuth callback handler to use pkg_resources
4. `test_package_contents.py` - Created comprehensive package verification script
5. `PYPI_PACKAGING_ANALYSIS.md` - This documentation file

The PyPI packaging now correctly includes all necessary assets for full functionality of the Escobar JupyterLab extension.
