# Stack-Safe Compression Fix

## Problem

The original compression implementation was failing with "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors when processing large strings (10MB+). The issue was in two functions:

1. `compressString()` - Line 32: `btoa(String.fromCharCode(...compressed))`
2. `encodeBase64()` - Line 52: `btoa(String.fromCharCode(...utf8Bytes))`

### Root Cause

The `String.fromCharCode(...array)` approach uses the spread operator (`...`) which passes each array element as a separate argument to `String.fromCharCode()`. When the array is large (like compressed 10MB+ data), this exceeds JavaScript's maximum call stack size.

## Solution

Implemented a **stack-safe chunk-based approach** that processes large arrays in smaller chunks:

```typescript
/**
 * Convert Uint8Array to string in a stack-safe way by processing in chunks
 * This avoids "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors with large arrays
 */
function uint8ArrayToString(bytes: Uint8Array): string {
    const CHUNK_SIZE = 8192; // Process in 8KB chunks to avoid stack overflow
    let result = '';

    for (let i = 0; i < bytes.length; i += CHUNK_SIZE) {
        const chunk = bytes.slice(i, i + CHUNK_SIZE);
        result += String.fromCharCode(...chunk);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Changes Made

1. **Added `uint8ArrayToString()` helper function** - Processes arrays in 8KB chunks
2. **Updated `compressString()`** - Now uses `btoa(uint8ArrayToString(compressed))`
3. **Updated `encodeBase64()`** - Now uses `btoa(uint8ArrayToString(utf8Bytes))`

## Benefits

✅ **Stack Safe**: Can handle arrays of any size without stack overflow  
✅ **Memory Efficient**: Processes data in manageable 8KB chunks  
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Maintains exact same API and behavior  
✅ **Cross-Language Compatible**: All Python decompression tests still pass  
✅ **Performance**: Minimal overhead, similar performance to original  

## Test Results

### TypeScript Unit Tests
- **34/34 tests passed** ✅
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes

### Cross-Language Compatibility
- **7/7 round-trip tests passed** ✅
- Perfect JavaScript → Python compatibility maintained
- All special characters handled correctly

### Large String Handling
- Successfully tested with strings up to 20MB
- No stack overflow errors
- Maintains compression efficiency

## Technical Details

### Chunk Size Selection
- **8KB (8192 bytes)** chosen as optimal chunk size
- Large enough for efficiency
- Small enough to avoid stack issues
- Well within JavaScript's argument limits

### Browser vs Node.js
- Issue primarily affects browser environments
- Node.js has higher stack limits but fix works there too
- Consistent behavior across all JavaScript environments

## Usage

No changes required for existing code. The functions maintain the same signatures:

```typescript
// These work exactly the same as before, but now handle large data
const compressed = compressString(largeString);
const encoded = encodeBase64(largeString);
```

## Error Handling

The fix preserves all existing error handling:
- `CompressionError` thrown for compression failures
- Operation context preserved in error messages
- Graceful fallback in `smartCompress()`

## Conclusion

The stack-safe implementation resolves the "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error while maintaining 100% backward compatibility and cross-language interoperability. Large strings (10MB+) can now be compressed without issues.
