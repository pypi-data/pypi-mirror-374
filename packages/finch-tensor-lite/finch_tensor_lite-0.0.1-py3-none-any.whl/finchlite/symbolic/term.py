"""
This module contains definitions for common functions that are useful for symbolic
expression manipulation. Its purpose is to provide a shared interface between various
symbolic programming in finchlite.

Classes:
    Term (ABC): An abstract base class representing a symbolic term. It provides methods
    to access the head of the term, its children, and to construct a new term with a
    similar structure.

Notes:
    Although TermTree implements `children`, `make_term` is defined under Term.
    The reason for this is to enable writing IR-agnostic passes that operate on any kind
    of term, whether it is a leaf or an internal node. For example, a function that
    constructs or transforms a tree term may only have access to a leaf node, but still
    needs to call `make_term` on it.

    For example:

        def insert_wrapper(node: Term, pattern, wrap_head):
            if matches(node, pattern):
                return node.make_term(wrap_head, node)
            elseif isinstance(node, TermTree):
                def recurse(node: Term) -> Term:
                    return insert_wrapper(node, pattern, wrap_head)
                return node.make_term(node.head(), *(
                    recurse(child) for child in node.children
                ))
            else:
                return node

    This function would not be able to wrap leaf nodes if Term didn't define
    `make_term`.

    Also, `make_term` is not meant to be written differently for different
    members of Term.  Instead of overriding `make_term` in subclasses, introduce
    your own method to override, and call that from make_term.
