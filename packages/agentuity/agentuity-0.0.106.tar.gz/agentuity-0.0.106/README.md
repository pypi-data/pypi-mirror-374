# Agentuity Python SDK


**Visit [https://agentuity.com](https://agentuity.com) to get started with Agentuity.**



The Agentuity Python SDK is a powerful toolkit for building, deploying, and managing AI agents in Python environments. This SDK provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools to create intelligent, event-driven agents that can process various types of content, communicate with each other, and integrate with external systems.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Build and orchestrate multiple interconnected agents that can communicate and collaborate.
- **Event-Driven Design**: Respond to various triggers including webhooks, cron jobs, SMS, voice, email, and more.
- **Rich Content Handling**: Process and generate multiple content types including JSON, text, markdown, HTML, and binary formats (images, audio, PDFs).
- **Persistent Storage**: Built-in key-value and vector storage capabilities for maintaining state and performing semantic searches.
- **Observability**: Integrated OpenTelemetry support for comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing.
- **Cross-Runtime Support**: Works seamlessly with both Node.js and Bun runtimes.

## Use Cases

- Building conversational AI systems
- Creating automated workflows with multiple specialized agents
- Developing content processing and generation pipelines
- Implementing intelligent data processing systems
- Building AI-powered APIs and services

## IO Modules

The SDK provides several IO modules for handling different types of input and output:

### Email
Process and reply to emails with support for attachments, HTML content, and rich formatting.

### Discord
Handle Discord messages and send replies with full integration to Discord's API.

### Telegram
Process Telegram messages and send replies with support for typing indicators and message formatting.

```python
from agentuity.io.telegram import Telegram, parse_telegram

# Parse a Telegram message from raw data
telegram_message = await parse_telegram(raw_data)

# Access message properties
print(f"From: {telegram_message.from_first_name}")
print(f"Message: {telegram_message.text}")

# Send a reply
await telegram_message.send_reply(request, context, "Hello! I received your message.")

# Send typing indicator
await telegram_message.send_typing(request, context)
```

See the [examples/telegram_example.py](examples/telegram_example.py) for a complete usage example.

## Getting Started

To use this SDK in a real project, you should install the Agentuity CLI.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://agentuity.sh | sh
```


Once installed, you can create a new project with the following command:

```bash
agentuity new
```


## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.10 or 3.11)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (latest version recommended)


### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/agenuity/sdk-py.git
cd sdk-py

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### Local Development

Create a new agent project or use an existing one like normal.

To link your local python SDK to your project, run the following commands:

Install the dependencies 
```bash
make install
```

Build the SDK:

```bash
make build
```

In your project, install the local SDK build:

```bash
uv add ~/path/to/sdk-py/dist/agentuity-0.0.83.post2+d07b43907c8002056fe3550ddef946d1dbb0eeff.tar.gz
```

Make sure to replace the path with the actual path to the SDK build.

Now you can run your project like normal.

```bash
agentuity dev
```
