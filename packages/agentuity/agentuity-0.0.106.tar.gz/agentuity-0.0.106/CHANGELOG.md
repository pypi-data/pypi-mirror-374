## [0.0.104] - 2025-08-28

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

The AgentContext constructor parameter has been renamed from `run_id` to `session_id` for better alignment with how we reference sessions. The `runId` property is still available for backward compatibility but is deprecated. ([#89](https://github.com/agentuity/sdk-py/pull/89))

### Changed
- Shortened Discord interface method name from `discord_message()` to `discord()` for improved usability ([#77](https://github.com/agentuity/sdk-py/pull/77))

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

```
