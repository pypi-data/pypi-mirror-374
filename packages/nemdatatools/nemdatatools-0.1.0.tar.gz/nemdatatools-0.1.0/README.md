# NEMDataTools

An MIT-licensed Python package for accessing and preprocessing data from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) for the National Electricity Market (NEM).

## Overview

NEMDataTools provides a clean, efficient interface for:
- Downloading raw data from AEMO's public data sources
- Processing various AEMO data formats
- Managing time series data with appropriate timestamps
- Supporting multiple data tables and report types
- Delivering preprocessed data ready for analysis

This package is designed for researchers, analysts, and developers who need to work with AEMO data under a permissive MIT license.

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install nemdatatools
```

### From TestPyPI (Pre-releases)

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ nemdatatools
```

### From Source (Development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ZhipengHe/nemdatatools.git
cd nemdatatools

# Install in development mode with all dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"

# Or install just the core package
pip install -e .
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pandas, numpy, requests, pyarrow, tqdm

## Quick Start

```python
import nemdatatools as ndt

# Download and process dispatch price data with automatic caching
data = ndt.fetch_data(
    data_type="DISPATCHPRICE",
    start_date="2023/01/01",
    end_date="2023/01/02",
    regions=["NSW1", "VIC1"],
    cache_path="./cache"  # Enable local caching
)

# Data is already processed and standardized
print(f"Downloaded {len(data)} records")
print(data.head())

# Advanced analysis with built-in functions
stats = ndt.calculate_price_statistics(data)
resampled = ndt.resample_data(data, '1H')  # Resample to hourly
windows = ndt.create_time_windows(data, window_size='4H')  # 4-hour windows
```

## Core Features

## API Reference

### Core Functions

```python
# Main data fetching function
data = ndt.fetch_data(
    data_type="DISPATCHPRICE",
    start_date="2023/01/01",
    end_date="2023/01/02",
