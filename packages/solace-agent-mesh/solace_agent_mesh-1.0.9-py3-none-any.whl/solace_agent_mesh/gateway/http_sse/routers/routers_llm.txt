Here is the DEVELOPER GUIDE for the `routers` directory.

## Quick Summary
The `routers` directory contains FastAPI `APIRouter` modules that define the REST API endpoints for the HTTP SSE Gateway. Each file groups endpoints by a specific domain of functionality, such as agent discovery, artifact management, user authentication, task submission, and real-time event streaming. These routers are the primary interface for frontend applications and other clients to interact with the gateway.

## Files Overview
- `__init__.py`: Marks the directory as a Python package.
- `agents.py`: API endpoints for discovering available A2A agents.
- `artifacts.py`: REST endpoints for managing session-specific artifacts (upload, download, list, delete).
- `auth.py`: Endpoints for handling the user authentication flow (login, callback, refresh, CSRF).
- `config.py`: API endpoint for providing configuration settings to the frontend application.
- `people.py`: API endpoints for user search functionality, typically for autocomplete features.
- `sessions.py`: API endpoints for managing user sessions (creating new sessions, getting current session info).
- `sse.py`: The Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint for streaming real-time task updates to the client.
- `tasks.py`: API endpoints for submitting tasks to agents and managing their lifecycle (e.g., cancellation).
- `users.py`: API endpoint for retrieving information about the currently authenticated user.
- `visualization.py`: API endpoints for managing A2A message visualization streams for monitoring and debugging.

## Developer API Reference

### agents.py
**Purpose:** Provides REST endpoints for agent discovery.
**Import:** `from src.solace_agent_mesh.gateway.http_sse.routers.agents import router`

**Functions:**
- `get_discovered_agents() -> List[AgentCard]`: Retrieves a list of all currently discovered and available A2A agents. The `AgentCard` type contains details about each agent.

**Usage Examples:**
```python
# To include this router in a FastAPI application
from fastapi import FastAPI
from src.solace_agent_mesh.gateway.http_sse.routers.agents import router

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(router, prefix="/api/v1")

# A client would make a GET request to /api/v1/agents
