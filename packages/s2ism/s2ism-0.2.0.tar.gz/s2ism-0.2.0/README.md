# s²ISM

This python package implements s²ISM (Super-resolution Sectioning Image Scanning Microscopy),
a computational technique to reconstruct images with enhanced resolution, optical sectioning, signal-to-noise ratio
and sampling from a conventional ISM dataset acquired by a laser scanning microscope equipped with a detector array.
The details of the method are described in the paper [Structured Detection for Simultaneous Super-Resolution and Optical Sectioning in Laser Scanning Microscopy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-025-01695-0).

The ISM dataset should be a numpy array in the format (x, y, channel), where the channel dimension is the flattened 2D
dimension of the detector array. If lifetime data are present, the array should be in the format (x, y, time, channel).

This package also contains a module for simulating instrument-specific PSFs by retrieving the 
relevant parameters automatically from the raw dataset with minimal user inputs.

## Installation

You can install `s2ism` via [pip] directly from GitHub:

    pip install git+https://github.com/VicidominiLab/s2ISM

or using the version on [PyPI]:

    pip install s2ism

It requires the following Python packages

    numpy
    matplotlib
    scipy
    scikit-image
    brighteyes-ism
    torch
    tqdm
