## 📊 **THIS WEEK'S GOALS**

### **Day 1-2: Release v0.1.2**
- [ ] Merge QC panel to develop
- [ ] Update version numbers
- [ ] Create changelog
- [ ] Tag and release v0.1.2
- [ ] Publish to PyPI

### **Day 3-5: Start Next Features**

---

## 🎯 **PRIORITY FEATURES (Next 2 Weeks)**

### **1. DotPlot Panel** 🔥 **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Why**: Most requested feature after heatmap
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Impact**: High - marker gene visualization

**Implementation Plan**:
```python
# pysee/panels/dotplot.py
class DotPlotPanel(BasePanel):
    def __init__(self, panel_id, genes, groupby, ...):
        # Marker gene dot plot visualization
        # Interactive features
        # Color/size mapping
```

### **2. Advanced Selection Tools** 🎯 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Why**: Improves user experience
**Effort**: 1-2 days
**Impact**: Medium - better interaction

**Implementation Plan**:
- Add lasso selection to UMAP panel
- Add polygon selection
- Improve selection UX

### **3. Jupyter Widget Integration** 📓 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Why**: Better notebook experience
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Impact**: Medium - notebook users

**Implementation Plan**:
- Create widget base class
- Convert panels to widgets
- Add notebook examples

## 💡 **KEY DECISIONS MADE**

### **✅ Focus on Feature Delivery**
- Prioritize user-facing features over performance optimization
- Get v0.1.2 released quickly for user feedback
- Build on solid foundation we have

### **✅ Defer Performance Optimization**
- GPU acceleration is complex and not critical
- Performance analysis is done for future planning
- Focus on user experience first

### **✅ Cloud-First for Large Datasets**
- Don't struggle with large datasets locally
- Use cloud for 100K+ cell datasets
- Keep local usage simple and fast
