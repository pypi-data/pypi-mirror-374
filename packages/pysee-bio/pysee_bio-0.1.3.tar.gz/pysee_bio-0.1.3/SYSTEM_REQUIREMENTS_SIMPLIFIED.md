# PySEE System Requirements - Simplified Approach

## 🎯 Realistic System Requirements

### **Local Development (Recommended)**
- **Minimum**: 8 GB RAM
- **Recommended**: 16 GB RAM  
- **Optimal**: 32 GB RAM
- **Use for**: Development, testing, small-medium datasets (up to 68K cells)

### **Cloud/Server (For Large Datasets)**
- **Google Colab**: Free tier (12 GB RAM) - good for medium datasets
- **Google Colab Pro**: 25 GB RAM - good for large datasets
- **AWS/GCP**: 32+ GB RAM - optimal for very large datasets
- **Use for**: Large datasets (100K+ cells), production analysis

## 📊 Dataset Size Guidelines

| Dataset Size | Cells | Memory | Local (16GB) | Cloud/Server |
|--------------|-------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Small        | 3K    | 350 MB | ✅ Perfect   | ✅ Perfect   |
| Medium       | 68K   | 8.5 GB | ⚠️ Caution   | ✅ Perfect   |
| Large        | 100K+ | 15+ GB | ❌ Not recommended | ✅ Recommended |
| Very Large   | 1M+   | 100+ GB| ❌ Not feasible | ✅ Required |

## 🚀 Recommended Workflow

### **1. Local Development**
```python
# Perfect for local development
import scanpy as sc
from pysee import PySEE

# Load small dataset
adata = sc.datasets.pbmc3k()  # 3K cells, 350 MB
app = PySEE(adata)
# ... add panels and test
```

### **2. Cloud for Large Datasets**
```python
# Google Colab example
!pip install pysee scanpy

import scanpy as sc
from pysee import PySEE

# Load large dataset (works in cloud)
adata = sc.datasets.pbmc68k_reduced()  # 68K cells, 8.5 GB
app = PySEE(adata)
# ... full analysis
```

### **3. Server Deployment**
```python
# For production or very large datasets
# Deploy on AWS/GCP with 32+ GB RAM
# Use backed mode for memory efficiency
adata = ad.read_h5ad('large_dataset.h5ad', backed='r')
app = PySEE(adata)
```

## 💡 User Guidance

### **For Researchers with 16 GB RAM:**
1. **Use locally**: Small datasets (3K cells) for development
2. **Use cloud**: Medium-large datasets (68K+ cells) for analysis
3. **Don't try**: Very large datasets (1M+ cells) locally

### **For Researchers with 32+ GB RAM:**
1. **Use locally**: Small-medium datasets (up to 68K cells)
2. **Use cloud**: Large datasets (100K+ cells) for better performance
3. **Consider local**: Very large datasets with backed mode

### **For Production/Teams:**
1. **Deploy on cloud**: Always use cloud for large datasets
2. **Use HPC**: For very large datasets (1M+ cells)
3. **Local development**: Only for small datasets and testing

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Don't overcomplicate**: Most users should use cloud for large datasets
2. **Focus on cloud deployment**: Make PySEE work great in cloud environments
3. **Simple local usage**: Keep local usage simple and realistic
4. **Clear boundaries**: 16 GB = up to 68K cells, 32+ GB = up to 100K cells, Cloud = 100K+ cells

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Simplify system requirements**: Remove complex memory strategies
2. **Focus on cloud deployment**: Add Google Colab, AWS examples
3. **Clear user guidance**: Simple rules for when to use local vs cloud
4. **Remove memory hacks**: Don't encourage users to struggle with limited RAM
