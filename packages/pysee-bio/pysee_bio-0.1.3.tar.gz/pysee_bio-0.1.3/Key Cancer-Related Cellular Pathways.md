# Key Cancer-Related Cellular Pathways

Cellular pathways are networks of genes and proteins that work together to control biological processes such as growth, survival, and death.  
In cancer, many of these pathways are dysregulated.  
Below is a list of **core pathways** often studied in oncology, with representative genes.

## 1. EGFR / MAPK Pathway
- **Function:** Promotes cell proliferation and survival.
- **Key Genes:**  
  - Receptor: *EGFR*  
  - Signal relay: *KRAS, BRAF*  
  - Kinases: *MEK1 (MAP2K1), ERK (MAPK1)*  

---

## 2. PI3K–AKT–mTOR Pathway
- **Function:** Regulates cell growth, metabolism, and survival.
- **Key Genes:**  
  - *PIK3CA* (PI3K catalytic subunit)  
  - *AKT1*  
  - *MTOR*  
  - *PTEN* (tumor suppressor, negative regulator)

## 3. JAK–STAT Pathway
- **Function:** Transmits cytokine signals; controls immune response and differentiation.
- **Key Genes:**  
  - *JAK1, JAK2*  
  - *STAT3, STAT5*

## 4. Cell Cycle Regulation
- **Function:** Controls timing of cell division.
- **Key Genes:**  
  - *CCND1* (Cyclin D1)  
  - *CDK1*  
  - *RB1* (retinoblastoma tumor suppressor)  
  - *TP53* (guardian of the genome)

## 5. Apoptosis Pathway
- **Function:** Programmed cell death to eliminate damaged or dangerous cells.
- **Key Genes:**  
  - Pro-apoptotic: *BAX, CASP3, CASP9*  
  - Anti-apoptotic: *BCL2*  

---

## 6. Immune Checkpoint Pathway
- **Function:** Modulates immune system activation; exploited by cancer to escape immune attack.
- **Key Genes:**  
  - *PDCD1 (PD-1)*  
  - *CD274 (PD-L1)*  
  - *CTLA4*

## Summary
- **Oncogenic pathways (EGFR/MAPK, PI3K–AKT–mTOR, JAK–STAT)** → often **upregulated** in cancer.  
- **Tumor suppressor pathways (Cell cycle, Apoptosis)** → often **inactivated or downregulated**.  
- **Immune checkpoint pathways** → manipulated by tumors to evade immunity.
