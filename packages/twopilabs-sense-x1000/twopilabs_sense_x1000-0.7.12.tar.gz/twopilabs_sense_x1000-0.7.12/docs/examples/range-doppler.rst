The Range-Dopppler example shows how the 2Ï€SENSE X1000 series devices can be used to perform FMCW sweeps with very precise and reliable timing.
An entire acquisition of multiple sweeps is processed using a range-doppler algorithm providing a 2D color-coded live image of both distance and recession velocity.
