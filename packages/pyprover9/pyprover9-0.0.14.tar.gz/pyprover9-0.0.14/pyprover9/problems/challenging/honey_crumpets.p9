%% Honey Crumpets
%% A logic problem by Brandon Bennett
%%
%% Prover9 file: honey_crumpets.p9

%% To solve this first-order logic proof problem, you must replace
%% each of the assumption place-holders __An__ and the goal place-holder
%% __G__, with an approapriate first-order formula that captures the
%% meaning of the given English sentence.
%% 
%% Then run Prover9. 
%% If your representations are correct, it should find a Proof.
%% You can also check your representations using the Gradescope Autograder.

%% In writing the formulae, you should only use the following vocabulary:
%%
%% Logical symbols:           &  |  -  ->   <->  =  all  exists
%% Brackets and separators:   ( )  [  ]  ,  .
%% Variables:                 Whatever you like, but must be quantified.
%%
%% Predicates: Honey, Butter, NextTo, Diagonal, Ate
%%
%% Use only the specified vocabulary, otherwise the autograder will not work.
