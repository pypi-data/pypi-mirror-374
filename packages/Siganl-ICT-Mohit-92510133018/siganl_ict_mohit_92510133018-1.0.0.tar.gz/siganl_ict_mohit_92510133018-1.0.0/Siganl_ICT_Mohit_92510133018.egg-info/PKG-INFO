## âœ… About this Project

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of signals and systems by creating a Python package for signal generation and operations.

The package includes:

### Modules:
1. **unitary_signals** â€“ Generates unit step, impulse, and ramp signals.
2. **trigonometric_signals** â€“ Generates sine, cosine, and exponential signals.
3. **operations** â€“ Performs time shifting, scaling, addition, and multiplication of signals.

### Main Script:
- `main.py` demonstrates how to generate, manipulate, and plot signals using the package.

### Test Script:
- `test_signal.py` contains tests to verify that the functions are working as expected.

## âœ… Features

- Generate and plot various discrete and continuous signals.
- Perform signal operations like shifting, scaling, addition, and multiplication.
- Interactive plotting using `matplotlib`.
- Well-structured Python package format.
- Easy to run and test.
