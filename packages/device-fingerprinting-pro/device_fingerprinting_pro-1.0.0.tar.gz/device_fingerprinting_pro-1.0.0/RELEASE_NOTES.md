# DeviceFingerprint Library - Release Notes

## Version 1.0.0 - September 6, 2025

### 🎉 Initial Release

We're excited to announce the first stable release of DeviceFingerprint Library - a professional-grade hardware-based device identification system for Python applications.

### 🚀 Key Features

#### Security-First Design
- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: SHA3-512 hashing provides protection against future quantum computing threats
- **Constant-Time Operations**: Implements timing attack protection for security-critical comparisons
- **No Silent Degradation**: Explicit error handling prevents security vulnerabilities from undetected failures
- **Secure Random Generation**: Uses cryptographically secure entropy sources for all random operations

#### Hardware-Based Identification
- **Multi-Component Analysis**: Examines CPU specifications, memory configuration, storage devices, and network hardware
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Consistent behavior across Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems
- **Stable Across Reboots**: Generates identical fingerprints for the same hardware configuration
- **Privacy-Aware Processing**: Sensitive information is cryptographically hashed, never stored in plain text

#### Enterprise-Ready Architecture
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Built entirely on Python's standard library for maximum compatibility
- **Multiple Confidence Levels**: Choose between Basic (0.7), Advanced (0.9), and Quantum-Resistant (0.95) methods
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with detailed warning systems
- **Token Binding Integration**: Secure device-specific token validation for authentication workflows

### 📋 What's Included

#### Core Components
- `AdvancedDeviceFingerprinter` - Primary class for advanced device fingerprinting operations
- `FingerprintMethod` - Enum with Basic, Advanced, and Quantum-Resistant methods
- `FingerprintResult` - Comprehensive result object with metadata
