"""Neo blockchain data provider

This module provides a comprehensive interface for interacting with the Neo blockchain
using neo-mamba library. It supports both mainnet and testnet networks and includes
various utility methods for data processing and validation.

The provider handles:
- Address validation and conversion
- Asset amount formatting
- JSON serialization
- Safe dictionary access
- Network-specific API endpoints
