This repository contains a modern reimplementation of HAZUS flood
vulnerability methodology. We welcome bug reports, feature requests, and
pull requests. By contributing you agree that your contributions will be

Getting started
- Fork the repository and create a topic branch for your change.
- Keep changes small and focused â€” one logical change per branch/PR.
- Write tests for bug fixes and new features where applicable.

Development environment
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (Python 3.10+).

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
```

2. Run tests:

```powershell
pytest
```

Code style
- Follow existing project style. We use type annotations and aim for
  clear, well-documented code.
- If adding new modules, include unit tests and update the README or other
  documentation if necessary.

Commit messages and PRs
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages. Keep commits focused and logical.
- When opening a PR, describe the problem, how your change fixes it, and
  any testing instructions.

Reporting issues
- Please file issues using the issue tracker. Include a minimal reproduction
  case and any relevant logs or input data.

Security
- Do not include secrets or credentials in the repository. If you discover a
  security vulnerability, please report it privately via the repository
  maintainer contact instead of opening a public issue.
