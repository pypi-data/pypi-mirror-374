"Standing on the shoulders of giants"

This project is inspired by many other software solutions and incorporates various third-party packages, design elements and artwork. 
We wish to express our gratitude to the creators and developers of these projects for their work and for inspiring our own design.


--------------------------------------------------------
Inspiration
--------------------------------------------------------
The free open-source software programm Glotaran (https://glotaran.org/) developed by Joris Snellenburg and coworkers is an excellent example of interactivity as well as powerfull and flexible calculations which influenced our approach to building an intuitive user experience.
Further the modular Python package KiMoPack (https://github.com/erdzeichen/KiMoPack) developed by Jens Uhlig under the GPL-3.0 license provides valuable insights into a thoughtful and streamlined workflow design inspiring our own design and implementations.
