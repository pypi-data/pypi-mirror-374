"""
Citation models for document reference tracking.

This module defines Pydantic models for managing citations and their associated
web segments. Citations track document references with scoring, positioning,
and source validation capabilities.

class Citation(BaseModel):

    Citation model for tracking document references and source validation.
    
    Represents a citation within a document including its position, relevance score,

    validation pipeline to assess source credibility and relevance.
    
    Attributes:
        score (float): Relevance or confidence score for this citation
        start_index (int): Starting character position in the document
        end_index (int): Ending character position in the document
