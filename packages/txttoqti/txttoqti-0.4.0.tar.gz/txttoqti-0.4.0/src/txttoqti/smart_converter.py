smart_converter.py: Advanced conversion features with change detection

This module provides the SmartConverter class, which enhances the conversion
process by detecting changes in the question bank and applying intelligent
updates to the QTI package.

Main Features:
- Change detection for question banks
- Intelligent updates to QTI packages
- Integration with the TxtToQtiConverter

Example Usage:
    >>> from txttoqti import SmartConverter
    >>> smart_converter = SmartConverter()
    >>> updated_qti_file = smart_converter.convert_with_changes("old_questions.txt", "new_questions.txt")
    >>> print(f"Updated QTI package created: {updated_qti_file}")
