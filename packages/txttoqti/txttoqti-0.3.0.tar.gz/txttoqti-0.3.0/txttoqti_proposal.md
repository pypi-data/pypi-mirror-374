# 🎓 Educational Extension Proposal for txttoqti

## Summary

We propose contributing an **Educational Extension** to txttoqti that provides a higher-level, auto-detecting interface specifically designed for academic institutions and course management workflows.

## Background & Motivation

While developing a 15-week **"Data Science Applied to Football"** course for high school students at Tecnológico de Monterrey, we identified key friction points when using txttoqti in educational environments:

- **Manual configuration overhead**: Educators need to specify file paths and manage multiple question banks
- **Repetitive workflows**: Similar conversion patterns repeated across course blocks/modules
- **Format gaps**: Common educational formats (Q1: A) B) C) D) RESPUESTA: X) require preprocessing
- **Limited batch processing**: No built-in support for multi-block course structures

## Proposed Solution: Educational Extension

A **531-line educational orchestration layer** that wraps txttoqti v0.3.0+ with zero-configuration auto-detection and enhanced educational workflows.

### 🚀 Core Features

#### 1. **Auto-Detection System**
```python
from txttoqti.educational import QtiConverter

# Zero configuration - detects everything automatically!
converter = QtiConverter()  # Detects block number, file names, directory structure
converter.show_status()     # Shows: "Block 1: Python fundamentals (25 questions)"
converter.convert()         # Handles format conversion + QTI generation
```

**Auto-detects:**
- Block/module number from directory structure (`course/block-1/`, `evaluaciones/bloque-2/canvas/`)
- Input filenames (`questions-block1.txt`, `banco-preguntas-bloque2.txt`) 
- Output filenames (`block1_canvas_qti.zip`)
- Course descriptions and metadata

#### 2. **Educational Format Bridge**
Converts common educational question formats to txttoqti-compatible format:

**Input Format (Educational Standard):**
```
Q1: What is the result of type(42) in Python?
A) <class 'float'>
B) <class 'int'>  
C) <class 'str'>
D) <class 'number'>
RESPUESTA: B

Q2: If I execute name = "Barcelona" and then print(len(name)), what prints?
A) 8
B) 9
C) 10  
D) Error
RESPUESTA: B
```

**Auto-converted to txttoqti format:**
```
1. What is the result of type(42) in Python?
a) <class 'float'>
b) <class 'int'>
c) <class 'str'>
d) <class 'number'>
Respuesta correcta: b

2. If I execute name = "Barcelona" and then print(len(name)), what prints?
a) 8
b) 9
c) 10
d) Error
Respuesta correcta: b
```

#### 3. **Enhanced Educational CLI**
```bash
# Same command works across all course blocks - auto-detects context!
python generar_qti.py                    # Convert with auto-detection
python generar_qti.py --status          # Show current block status  
python generar_qti.py --force           # Force regeneration
python generar_qti.py --interactive     # Guided troubleshooting mode
python generar_qti.py --help            # Educational-friendly help
```

#### 4. **Smart Change Detection & Batch Processing**
- **MD5-based change detection**: Only regenerates when source files change
- **Multi-block support**: Process entire courses with single commands
- **Progress reporting**: Clear feedback for large question banks
- **Error recovery**: Detailed validation with educational-specific error messages

## Real-World Production Impact

**Successfully deployed in production** for a complete 15-week curriculum:

- **3 course blocks** (Python fundamentals, Data exploration, Machine learning)
- **75+ questions** across multiple evaluation formats
- **Zero configuration** required for instructors
- **37% code reduction** from original implementation (624 → ~400 effective lines)
- **100% backward compatibility** with existing txttoqti workflows

### Before & After Comparison

**Before (Manual txttoqti usage):**
```python
# Manual for each block - lots of repetition and configuration
from txttoqti import TxtToQtiConverter

# Block 1
converter1 = TxtToQtiConverter()
# Need to manually convert format first
# Need to specify exact file paths  
# Need to manage multiple outputs
converter1.convert_file('manually-converted-block1.txt', 'block1_output.zip')

# Block 2 - repeat entire process
# Block 3 - repeat entire process
```

**After (Educational Extension):**
```python
# Auto-detects everything - works identically across all blocks
from txttoqti.educational import QtiConverter

converter = QtiConverter()  # Magic auto-detection!
converter.convert()         # Handles everything automatically
```

## Proposed Integration Options

### Option A: New `txttoqti.educational` Module ⭐ (Recommended)
```
txttoqti/
├── core/              # Existing core functionality (unchanged)
├── educational/       # NEW: Educational orchestration layer
│   ├── __init__.py    # QtiConverter, BlockDetector, FormatConverter
│   ├── converter.py   # Main QtiConverter orchestration class  
│   ├── detector.py    # Auto-detection utilities (paths, blocks, files)
│   ├── formats.py     # Educational format converters  
│   └── utils.py       # File management, change detection
└── cli/               # Enhanced CLI with educational features
    └── edu_cli.py     # Educational command-line interface
```

### Option B: Separate `txttoqti-edu` Package
- Companion package: `pip install txttoqti-edu`
- Depends on `txttoqti>=0.3.0`
- Focused on educational/institutional use cases

### Option C: Educational Examples & Templates
- Add to txttoqti's `examples/educational/` directory  
- Showcase advanced institutional usage patterns
- Templates for course/institutional deployments

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- **txttoqti**: `>=0.3.0` (uses as underlying engine)
- **Python**: `>=3.10` (for modern type hints and match statements)
- **Standard library only**: `pathlib`, `re`, `hashlib`, `os`, `sys`

### Architecture 
- **Modular design**: Each component is independently testable
- **Composition over inheritance**: Uses txttoqti as dependency, doesn't modify it
- **Zero breaking changes**: Purely additive to existing txttoqti functionality
- **Type hints throughout**: Full typing support for better IDE experience

### Key Classes

```python
class QtiConverter:
    """Orchestrates complete educational QTI conversion workflow."""
    
    def __init__(self, script_path: Optional[Path] = None)
    def show_status(self) -> None
    def convert(self, force: bool = False) -> bool
    def get_file_info(self) -> dict
```

#### `BlockDetector` - Auto-Detection Magic
```python
class BlockDetector:
    """Auto-detects course structure from directory paths."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def detect_block_info(script_path: Path) -> Tuple[str, str, str]
    
    @staticmethod  
    def get_block_description(block_num: str) -> str
```

#### `FormatConverter` - Educational Format Bridge
```python
class FormatConverter:
    """Converts between educational and txttoqti formats."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def convert_to_txttoqti_format(input_file: str, output_file: str) -> str
    
    @staticmethod
    def validate_question_format(content: str) -> Tuple[bool, List[str]]
```

## Testing & Validation
