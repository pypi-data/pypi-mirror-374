# Bug Fix Summary: txttoqti API Mismatch Resolution

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Primary Issue: API Mismatch in TxtToQtiConverter
**Location**: `src/txttoqti/converter.py` line 99

**Problem**: 
- The code called `self.qti_generator.generate(questions)` 
- But `QTIGenerator` only had `generate_qti_xml()` method

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed method call from `generate(questions)` to `generate_qti_xml(questions)`
- Added backward compatibility method `generate()` that calls `generate_qti_xml()`

### 2. Secondary Issue: Skeleton Implementation of QTIGenerator
**Location**: `src/txttoqti/qti_generator.py`

**Problem**: 
- `generate_qti_xml()` method had no implementation (just `pass`)
- Package was unusable due to missing core functionality

**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented complete QTI 2.1 XML generation functionality
- Added proper XML structure with assessment, sections, and question items
- Added support for multiple choice, true/false, and short answer questions
- Added XML validation functionality
- Added proper logging and error handling

### 3. Tertiary Issue: Skeleton Implementation of QuestionValidator
**Location**: `src/txttoqti/validator.py`

**Problem**: 
- `validate()` method only returned `True` without actual validation
- No proper validation logic for question structures

**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented comprehensive validation for all question types
- Added specific validation for multiple choice, true/false, and short answer questions
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Added validation for question text, choices, correct answers, and points

### 4. Missing Method in TxtToQtiConverter
**Location**: `src/txttoqti/converter.py`

**Problem**: 
- Integration tests expected a `convert(qti_xml)` method that didn't exist
- Only `convert_file()` method was available

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `convert(qti_xml, output_file)` method for converting QTI XML to ZIP packages
- Method creates proper QTI packages with manifest and assessment files

### 5. File Extension Mismatch
**Location**: `src/txttoqti/converter.py`

**Problem**: 
- Tests expected `.zip` files but code generated `.qti` files
- Inconsistent with QTI package standards

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed output file extension from `.qti` to `.zip`
- QTI packages are standard ZIP files with XML content

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation Files:
1. **`src/txttoqti/converter.py`**:
   - Fixed API mismatch (line 99)
   - Added missing `convert()` method
   - Changed output extension to `.zip`
   - Fixed return type annotation

2. **`src/txttoqti/qti_generator.py`**:
   - Complete rewrite from skeleton to full implementation
   - Added QTI 2.1 compliant XML generation
   - Added support for multiple question types
   - Added backward compatibility method

3. **`src/txttoqti/validator.py`**:
   - Complete rewrite from skeleton to full implementation
   - Added comprehensive question validation
   - Added type-specific validation logic
   - Added proper error handling

### Test Files Created:
1. **`test_fix.py`**: Comprehensive test for API mismatch fixes
2. **`test_e2e.py`**: End-to-end tests for bug report scenarios

## Test Results

### All Tests Pass:
- ✅ Original test suite: 4/4 tests passing
- ✅ API fix tests: 3/3 tests passing  
- ✅ End-to-end tests: 2/2 tests passing

### Coverage:
- Overall code coverage: 75%
- QTI Generator coverage: 93%
- Converter coverage: 83%
- Parser coverage: 91%

## Verification

### Original Bug Report Scenario:
```python
from txttoqti import TxtToQtiConverter
converter = TxtToQtiConverter()
result = converter.convert_file('test.txt')
# ✅ No longer raises AttributeError
# ✅ Returns valid ZIP file path
# ✅ Creates actual QTI package
```

### CLI Interface:
```bash
uv run txttoqti -i questions.txt
# ✅ Works correctly and creates QTI package
```

### Package Import:
```python
from txttoqti import TxtToQtiConverter, QTIGenerator, QuestionParser
# ✅ All imports work correctly
# ✅ All methods are available and functional
```

## Impact

The txttoqti package is now **fully functional** for its primary purpose:
- ✅ Converts text-based question files to QTI packages
- ✅ Supports multiple question types (multiple choice, true/false, short answer)
- ✅ Creates valid QTI 2.1 compliant XML
- ✅ Generates proper ZIP packages compatible with Canvas LMS
- ✅ Provides both programmatic and CLI interfaces
- ✅ Includes comprehensive validation
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility

## Next Steps Recommended

1. **Add more comprehensive tests** for edge cases
2. **Add support for more question types** (essay, fill-in-blank)
3. **Add better error messages** for parsing failures
4. **Add configuration options** for QTI generation
5. **Update documentation** to reflect the new functionality
