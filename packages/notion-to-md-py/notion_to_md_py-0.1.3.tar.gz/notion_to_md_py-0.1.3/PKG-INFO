# notion-to-md (Python Version)

This is the **Python implementation** of nodejs version of [notion-to-md](https://github.com/souvikinator/notion-to-md), 
a tool that converts Notion pages into Markdown files.

## Installation

Install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install notion-to-md-py
```

## Usage

### Sync Version

```python
from notion_client import Client
from notion_to_md import NotionToMarkdown


notion = Client(auth="your-auth-token")

n2m = NotionToMarkdown(notion)

# Export a page as a markdown blocks
md_blocks = n2m.page_to_markdown("page-id")

# Convert markdown blocks to string
md_str = n2m.to_markdown_string(md_blocks).get('parent')

# Write to a file
with open("output.md", "w") as f:
    f.write(md_str)
```

### Async Version
```python
import asyncio
from notion_client import AsyncClient
from notion_to_md import NotionToMarkdownAsync


notion = AsyncClient(auth="your-auth-token")

n2m = NotionToMarkdownAsync(notion)

# Export a page as a markdown blocks
md_blocks = asyncio.run(n2m.page_to_markdown("page-id"))

# Convert markdown blocks to string
md_str = n2m.to_markdown_string(md_blocks).get('parent')

# Write to a file
with open("output.md", "w") as f:
    f.write(md_str)
```

Replace `your-auth-token` and `page-id` with the appropriate values from your Notion account.

## Authentication with Notion API

1. Create an integration in your Notion account and get the `API key`.
2. Share your database with the integration to allow access.
3. Retrieve your `Database ID` and `Page ID` from the Notion app.


## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Notion API key

## Limitations

- The tool relies on the Notion API, and features are limited to what the API supports.
- Embedding or downloading files other than images is not supported.
