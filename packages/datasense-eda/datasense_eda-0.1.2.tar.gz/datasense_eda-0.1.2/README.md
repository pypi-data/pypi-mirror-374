## ✨ Features

- **Dataset Summary**: Overview of shape, dtypes, missing values, duplicates.  
- **Missing Value Handling**: Detect and impute missing values (mean, median, mode, constant, drop).  
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify outliers using Z-score or IQR methods.  
- **Feature Importance**: Calculate and visualize feature importance for regression/classification.  
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Decomposition, rolling statistics, and trend detection.  
- **Visualizations**: Histograms, boxplots, count plots, correlation matrices, scatter plots, pair plots.  
- **Automated Recommendations**: Get actionable insights for data preprocessing.
