  If neither expression nor weight are typed (i.e., neither has a `weight_type`
  attribute), the arc and weight types of the default context ("standard" and
  the associated "tropical", respectively, unless otherwise specified) are
  used.

  If the expression is typed but the weight is not, the expression's weight
  type is used to type the weight object to prevent weight mismatch.

  If the expression is untyped but the weight is typed, the weight types must
  match the weight type of the default context ("tropical" unless otherwise
  specified) or a weight mismatch exception will be thrown.

  If both the expression and the weight are typed, their weight types must
  match or a weight mismatch exception will be thrown.
