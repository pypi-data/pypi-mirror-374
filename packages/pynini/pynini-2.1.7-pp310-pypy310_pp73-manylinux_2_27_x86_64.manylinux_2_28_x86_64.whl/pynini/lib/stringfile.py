"""Utility file for automatically generating Stringfiles for Pynini and Thrax.

This file exposes a `stringfile.escape` function which can be used to escape a
string literal for use as a field in a stringfile as well as a
`stringfile.writeline` and `stringfile.writelines` to use in a similar way to
`csv.writer.writerow` and `csv.writer.writerows`.
