[CDF-25676] ðŸ¤¨Remove upper bound packaging (#1913)

# Description

This upper bound was to make `poetry` happy. It is unnecessarily strict
leading to compatibility issues with other packages such as
`cognite-neat`, so I am removing it.


## Changelog

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Skip

## cdf

### Fixed

- Removed upper bound on third-party dependency `packaging`. This makes
toolkit compatible with other applications.

## templates

No changes.
