## cdf 

### Improved

- [alpha] When running the commands `cdf purge/download/upload` the user
now use the q-key to abort the operation. This is to avoid accidentally
pressing `enter`, which was the previous version.

### Fixed

- [alpha} When downloading a raw table `cdf download raw`, the CLI now
correctly exits when the operation is interrupted by the user.
