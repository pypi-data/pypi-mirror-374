# Description

In addition to the change described below. I did some cleanup and
simplification of the WorkerProducer.

## Changelog

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Skip

## cdf

### Improved

- [alpha] When running the commands `cdf purge/download/upload` the user
now use the q-key to abort the operation. This is to avoid accidentally
pressing `enter`, which was the previous version.

### Fixed

- [alpha} When downloading a raw table `cdf download raw`, the CLI now
correctly exits when the operation is interrupted by the user.

## templates

No changes.
