	"Instructions": "You will now perform the pre-learned sequence for the FOOT stomping task: 212321324241. While you perform the task, letters will be shown on the screen (C, G, Q or O). In between each letter a red fixation cross will appear shortly. The goal is to perform the sequence stomping while counting how many times G is presented. After each time you stomped the full sequence, you should tell us how many times G was presented. For answering this question, keep in mind that you press the right key on your keyboard according to your answer (not the number of the sequence!). We will perform 11 trials. For each trial you perform the sequence once. Note that during the stomping task you cannot talk. Try to keep your body movements as still as possible exept for your right leg. Keep your eyes open (also during the rest periods). In between the trials you will see a fixation cross for 20 seconds. During the first few seconds you will hear a metronome sound. Stomp the sequence on this rhythm, which is the same as you studied at home. We will start with a fixation cross on the screen for 20 seconds. After that the first trial will start automatically. So start stomping the sequence as soon as a RED fixation cross appears on the screen. When ready: press any key to continue and start the test.",
