# adif-mcp

Core [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) service for **Amateur Radio Logging**, per [ADIF 3.1.5 specification](https://adif.org.uk/315/ADIF_315.htm)

> **Pretty Code â€¢ Pretty Output â€¢ Iterative Docs** - A simple mantra: keep the code clean, the output clear, and the docs evolving.

## Project Ethos

ADIF-MCP is a community-driven effort.
It is not intended to replace or compete with existing ADIF libraries, utilities, or logging applications. Instead, it provides a common foundation that others can build upon.

- Interoperability â€” a schema-driven, spec-compliant core that makes it easier for tools, logs, and services to talk to each other.
- Extensibility â€” a plugin and integration framework for services like LoTW, eQSL, QRZ, and future platforms.
- Collaboration â€” designed to complement, not fragment, the ecosystem of ADIF tools already enjoyed by the ham community.
- Future-facing â€” introduces safe, typed access to ADIF data in contexts such as AI agents and MCP integrations, opening doors for innovation while preserving compatibility.

Our goal is simple: support and enhance the Amateur Radio logging ecosystem while keeping the project open, transparent, and aligned with the spirit of the hobby.

## ADIF-MCP Engines

This package defines the ADIF MCP core engine, with plugins for:
- LoTW (`adif-mcp-lotw`)
- eQSL (`adif-mcp-eqsl`)
- qrz  (`adif-mcp-qrz`)
- clublog (`adif-mcp-clublog`)

Performs these tasks
- Validation & normalization of ADIF records
- Unified schema for consistent QSO storage and exchange
- MCP-ready tools for safe AI-agent access
- Foundation for service adapters (e.g., LoTW, eQSL, Qrx, Clublog)

ðŸ”‘ Takeaway: MCP doesnâ€™t replace LoTW, eQSL, Clublog, Qrz, or award / logging program(s). Instead, it gives operators visibility and accessibility into their award progress, across sponsors, without them needing to export, filter, or code.

---

## Why ADIF-MCP Matters

Unlike existing ADIF editors and one-off utilities, ADIF-MCP is a shared protocol engine for the Amateur Radio community:
- Spec-compliant & typed â€” ADIF fields are validated against the official standard.
- Extensible â€” integrations (LoTW, eQSL, QRZ, Clublog, and other logging apps) plug into a common base.
- AI-ready â€” exposes safe, typed tools to AI agents via the Model Context Protocol.
- Foundation, not silo â€” one engine many apps can trust, instead of everyone re-implementing ADIF parsing.

ðŸ‘‰ ADIF-MCP turns ADIF from a static file format into a living protocol interface.

---

## Next Steps
- Build `adif-mcp-lotw` and `adif-mcp-eqsl` adapters
- Expose MCP tools for validation, award tracking, and service sync
- Support cross-logger interoperability with AI-driven agents

## Compliance & Provenance

ADIF-MCP and its plugins follow the [ADIF Specification](https://adif.org.uk) (currently 3.1.5) and use **registered Program IDs** to identify all exports:

- `ADIF-MCP` â€” Core engine
- `ADIF-MCP-LOTW` â€” Plugin for ARRL Logbook of The World
- `ADIF-MCP-EQSL` â€” Plugin for eQSL.cc
- `ADIF-MCP-QRZ` â€” Plugin for Qrz.com
- `ADIF-MCP-CLUBLOG` â€” Plugin for Clublog.com
- `ADIF-MCP-NEXT` â€” Whatever else operators want integrated

To ensure transparency and auditability, the project also uses **APP_ fields** for provenance when augmenting records.
Examples include:

- `APP_ADIF-MCP_OP` â†’ operation performed (`normalize`, `validate`, `merge`)
- `APP_ADIF-MCP-LOTW_ACTION` â†’ LoTW plugin operation
- `APP_ADIF-MCP-EQSL_TIME` â†’ timestamp of eQSL merge

See the [Program ID & APP_ Field Policy](docs/program-id-policy.md) for full details.
