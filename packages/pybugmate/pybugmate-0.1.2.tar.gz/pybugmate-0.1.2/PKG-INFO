# PyBugMate

**[PyPI-READY] Effortless, smart debugging and postmortem for every Python project. Track errors, see real data, get smart hints, and drop into a REPL instantly—zero setup!**

---

## ✨ Features

- Automatic error tracing: See which function crashed, with parameters and variable values.
- Colorful, instant logs: [CALL], [RETURN], [PROFILE], [EXCEPTION]—all clear and readable!
- Smart hints: Friendly, actionable tips for common Python mistakes.
- Drop-in postmortem: On any unhandled error, instantly debug in a live REPL (IPython shell).
- No config, zero boilerplate: Add two lines—works everywhere, from scripts to complex apps.

## 🚀 Installation

pip install pybugmate


## 🧑‍💻 Usage: Quick Start

Paste these lines at the top of your script:
from pybugmate.postmortem import enable_postmortem   
from pybugmate.autowrap import autowrap

enable_postmortem()              # Step 1: Enable postmortem REPL for ANY unhandled crash !

# Define your functions normally
def foo(x): 
    return x+1

def bar(y): 
    return foo(y) * 2

autowrap(globals())              # Step 2: Auto-wrap all your functions for smart tracing
### (Call this after defining functions you want wrapped...)

### Now call your functions as usual
result = bar(5)
print(result)
