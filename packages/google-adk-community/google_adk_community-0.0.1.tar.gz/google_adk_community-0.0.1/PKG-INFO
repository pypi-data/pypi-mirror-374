# ADK Python Community Contributions
Welcome to the official community repository for the ADK (Agent Development Kit)! This repository is home to a growing ecosystem of community-contributed tools, third-party service integrations, and deployment scripts that extend the core capabilities of the ADK.

# What is this Repository For?
While the core adk-python repository provides a stable, focused framework for building agents, this adk-python-community repository is a place for innovation and collaboration. It's designed to:

- Foster a vibrant ecosystem of tools and integrations around the ADK.

- Provide a streamlined process for community members to contribute their work.

- House useful modules that, while not part of the core framework, are valuable to the community (e.g., integrations with specific databases, cloud services, or third-party tools).

This approach allows the core ADK to remain stable and lightweight, while giving the community the freedom to build and share powerful extensions.

# Repository Structure
The repository is organized into modules that mirror the structure of the core ADK, making it easy to find what you need:

plugins: Reusable plugins for common agent lifecycle events.

services: Integrations with external services, like databases, vector stores, or APIs.

tools: Standalone tools that can be used by agents.

deployment: Scripts and configurations to help you deploy your ADK agents to various platforms.

# We Welcome Your Contributions!
This is a community-driven project, and we would love for you to get involved. Whether it's adding a new service integration, fixing a bug, or improving documentation, your contributions are welcome.

We have established a clear and streamlined process to make contributing as easy as possible. To get started, please read our CONTRIBUTING.md file.

# Governance and Maintenance
This repository is maintained by the community, for the community. Our governance model is designed to be transparent and empower our contributors. It includes roles like Module Owners (the original contributors), Approvers, and Repo Maintainers.

We also have a clear Contribution Lifecycle and Deprecation Policy to ensure the long-term health and reliability of the ecosystem.
