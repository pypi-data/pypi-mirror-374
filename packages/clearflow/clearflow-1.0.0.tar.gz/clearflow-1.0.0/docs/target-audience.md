# Target Audience

## Who Uses ClearFlow

Python engineers building mission-critical AI orchestration who:

- **Embrace functional programming** - Pure functions, immutable data, explicit effects
- **Demand type safety** - Full static typing, no runtime surprises
- **Build critical systems** - Healthcare, finance, aerospace AI applications
- **Practice deep immutability** - Frozen dataclasses, tuples, never mutate
- **Require provable correctness** - 100% test coverage, all paths verified

## Contributing

Good contributions:

- Bug fixes that maintain 100% coverage
- Examples showing real workflow patterns
- Performance improvements with benchmarks

What gets rejected:

- Features that add complexity without clear benefit
- External dependencies
- Anything that reduces type safety
