## Our Standards

We expect all participants in our project's discussions, issue trackers, and other communication channels to adhere to

insults.

**Keep it On-Topic**: Focus on the technical and practical aspects of the project. Help us keep discussions productive and
relevant.

 - Deliberate intimidation. 
 - Unwelcome attention.
