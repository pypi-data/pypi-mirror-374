              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# zcompy

**zcompy** (**z**sh **comp**letion using **Py**thon) is a Python library that makes it easy to generate sophisticated zsh completion scripts for your command-line tools.

Instead of writing complex zsh completion scripts by hand, you can define your commands and options in Python and let zcompy generate the completion for you.

## Features

- 🐍 **Pure Python**: Define completions using familiar Python syntax
- 🎯 **Type-safe**: Built-in support for common argument types (files, directories, strings)
- 🔄 **Sub-commands**: Full support for nested sub-commands
- 🎨 **Custom completions**: Define your own completion functions with python functions
- 🔗 **Dependencies**: Completion could depend on other option values

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install zcompy
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FateScript/zcompy.git
cd zcompy
pip install -e .
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FateScript/zcompy.git
cd zcompy
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from zcompy import Command, Option, Files, Completion

# Create your command
mytool = Command("mytool", "My awesome command-line tool")

# Add global options for mytool
mytool.add_options([
    Option(("--verbose", "-v"), "Enable verbose output"),
    Option(("--config", "-c"), "Config file path", complete_func=Files())
])

# Create sub-commands
build_cmd = Command("build", "Build the project")
build_cmd.add_options([
    Option(
        ("--output", "-o"), "Output directory",
        complete_func=Files(dir_only=True)
    ),
    Option(
        ("--optimize", "-O"), "Optimization level",
        complete_func=Completion(func=("o1", "o2", "o3"))
    )
])

# Add sub-command to main command
mytool.add_sub_commands(build_cmd)

# print completion source
print(mytool.complete_source())
# Also, you might generate zsh completion code in output dir
# mytool.completion_entry(output_dir="~/.zsh/completion")
```

Then add to your `~/.zshrc` or run in your terminal sesssion:
```bash
fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)
autoload -U compinit && compinit
compdef _mytool mytool
```

👉 Please type `mytool` in cli and press `<TAB>` to feel the magic 🪄

## Usage

### Basic Command Structure

```python
from zcompy import Command, Option, Completion, Files

# Create a command
cmd = Command("mycmd", "Description of your command")

# Add options
cmd.add_options([
    Option(("--flag", "-f"), "Turn on to enable something"),
    Option(("--file",), "Input file", complete_func=Files()),
    Option(("--dir",), "Output directory", complete_func=Files(dir_only=True))
])
```

### Sub-commands

```python
# Create main command
main = Command("git", "Git version control")

# Create sub-commands
status = Command("status", "Show working tree status")
commit = Command("commit", "Record changes to repository")
commit.add_options([
    Option(("--message", "-m"), "Commit message", type="STRING"),
    Option(("--amend",), "Amend previous commit")
])

# Add sub-commands to main
main.add_sub_commands([status, commit])
```

### Custom Completions

Define your own completion functions

NOTE: 
1. To make your completions work, simply print each completion string to stdout.
2. If you want to show descriptions for completions, print them after a space, like: `completion description`.

```python
def list_things():
    for item in ["thing1", "thing2", "thing3"]:
        print(f"my_{item}")

branch_option = Option(
    ("--things", "-t"), 
    "things to describe",
    type="THINGS", 
    complete_func=Completion(list_things)
)
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Automatic CLI Framework Support

zcompy provides built-in support for generating completions from popular Python CLI frameworks:

##### ArgumentParser support
```python
from argparse import ArgumentParser
from zcompy.parser_command import ParserCommand

# Create your argparse parser
parser = ArgumentParser(prog="mytool", description="My awesome CLI tool")
parser.add_argument("--verbose", "-v", action="store_true", help="Enable verbose output")
parser.add_argument("--config", "-c", type=str, help="Config file path")
parser.add_argument("--mode", choices=["auto", "manual", "disabled"], help="Operation mode")

# Add sub-commands
subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest="command")
build_parser = subparsers.add_parser("build", help="Build the project")
build_parser.add_argument("--output", "-o", type=str, help="Output directory")

# Generate completion using zcompy
parser_command = ParserCommand(parser)
command = parser_command.to_command()
print(command.complete_source())

# Add custom completion for file paths
from zcompy.action import Files
parser_command.add_action_for_options("--config", "--output", action=Files())
```

##### Abseil ([absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py)) Support
```python
from absl import flags
from zcompy.absl_command import AbslFlagsCommand

# Define your absl flags
FLAGS = flags.FLAGS
flags.DEFINE_string('name', 'World', 'The name to greet')
flags.DEFINE_integer('count', 1, 'The number of greetings')
flags.DEFINE_bool('verbose', False, 'Whether to display verbose output')
flags.DEFINE_enum('color', 'blue', ['red', 'blue', 'green'], 'Choose a color')

# Generate completion using zcompy
cmd = AbslFlagsCommand(name="mytool").to_command()
print(cmd.complete_source())
```

##### [Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) Support

Users could use FireCommand like [fire-guide](https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/guide.md).

###### python class
```python
import fire
from zcompy.fire_command import FireCommand

class MyCLI:
    """My awesome CLI tool."""

    def add(self, x, y):
        """Addition command"""
        return x + y

    def mul(self, a, b):
        """Multiplication command"""
        return a * b

    def build(self, output_dir="./build", optimize=True):
        """Build the project"""
        return f"Building to {output_dir}"

# Generate completion using zcompy
fire_cmd = FireCommand(name="mytool", obj=MyCLI)
command = fire_cmd.to_command()
print(command.complete_source())
```

##### python function

```python
def add_func(x, y):
    """Addition command"""
    return x + y

fire_cmd = FireCommand(name="calc", obj=add_func)
command = fire_cmd.to_command()
print(command.complete_source())
```

##### python dict

```python
func_dict = {"add": lambda x, y: x + y, "mul": lambda a, b: a * b}
fire_cmd = FireCommand(name="math", obj=func_dict)
command = fire_cmd.to_command()
print(command.complete_source())
```

#### Dependent Completions

Completions could depend on other options' value/existence:

```python
from zcompy import DependentCompletion, Option

def complete_based_on_config(config_path):
    """Complete based on config_path value."""
    if config_path and os.path.exists(config_path):
        # Read config and provide completions
        with open(config_path) as f:
            configs = f.read().splitlines()
        for line, config in enumerate(configs):
            print(f"{config} line {line + 1}")

config_dependent = Option(
    ("--target",), 
    "Target based on config",
    type="TARGET",
    complete_func=DependentCompletion(
        func=complete_based_on_config,
        depends_on="--config"
    )
)
```

#### Positional Arguments

```python
from zcompy.action import GitBranches, GitCommits

# Add positional arguments
cmd.add_positional_args([
    Files("*.py"),
    GitBranches(),
    GitCommits(),
])

# Use repeat_pos_args if you want to repeat positional arguments.
# for example, `cmd file1 file2 file3`
cmd.repeat_pos_args = Files()
```
