Comber

Comber is a parser combinator library for creating text parsers in plain Python with a BNF flavor.

For instance, we could define a simple grammar for calling functions on integer values like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from comber import C, rs, inf
    
    keyword = rs(r'[_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*')@('keyword')
    number = rs(r'[0-9]+')@('number', int)
    package = keyword[1, inf, ',']
    import_statement = C+ 'import' + package
    value = keyword | number
    function_call = keyword + '(' + value**',' + ')'
    assignment = C+ 'let' + keyword + '=' + (function_call | value)
    grammar = (import_statement | assignment | function_call)[0, inf]

Our toy grammar can handle simple import statements, variable assignment, and function calling. For example::

    import math
    import sys.io
    
    let user_number = read()
    let double = multiple(user_number, 2)
    
    print(double)

To use our parser, we simply pass a string to it:

.. code-block:: python

    from comber import ParseError

    code = "add(17, 3)"
    try:
        parseState = grammar(code)
        print('Parsed tokens: %s' % parseState.tree)
    except ParseError as ex:
        print(ex)

The ``grammar`` call returns the final parser state on a successful parse, from which you can retrieve the final parse
tree. In our case, it is effectively a list::

    ['add', '(', 17, 3, ')']

Our grammar only supports variables and integers. Suppose we tried to assign pythong-style string to a variable::
    
    let text = "Here's some text"

If we tried to parse this, we'd get an exception like::

    1:12: Unexpected Text: "Here's som. Expected one of: @keyword, @number

Building Parsers
================

The most basic parsers are string literals (which match exactly), ``rs`` for matching a regular expression, and ``cs`` for
matching any of the strings of an iterable.

The ``rs`` parser can be seen in our toy grammar above. Standard Python regular expressions are supported. The entire
match is used as the result of the parse, regardless of groupings etc.

The ``cs`` parse takes any iterable of strings. The first string that exactly matches (the start of) the input text. If
none of the strings match, the parse fails. Since strings are themselves iterables, we could add addition and
subtraction to our toy grammar like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from comber import C, cs

    addition = value + cs('+-') + value
    assignment = C+ 'let' + keyword + '=' + (addition | function_call | value)

String literals can only be used in combination with other parsers. If a string literal would start a sequence, or
otherwise appear alone, make use of the C parser.

------------
The C Parser
------------

The C parser, on its own, consumes no text, produces no tokens, and always succeeds. It's most useful for starting a
parser that would otherwise begin with a string literal. E.g. this:

.. code-block:: python

    'let' + keyword + '=' + (function_call | value)

would actually throw a Python error because 'let' isn't *really* a parser - yet! That's where ``C`` comes in:

.. code-block:: python

    C+ 'let' + keyword + '=' + (function_call | value)

``C`` starts off the sequence, so we can use any combination of parsers and string literals we like from there. It works
similarly with alternatives, so if we wanted to allow ``set`` to be used as a synonym for ``let``, we might do:

.. code-block:: python

    (C| 'let'|'set') + keyword + '=' + (function_call | value)

``C`` can also be used to wrap a parser to protect it from optimization; for instance, embedding one sequence or
alternative set inside another. If, for instance, we extended our grammar to allow a bare value to be a whole statement:

.. code-block:: python

    value = (keyword | number)@'value'
    grammar = (import_statement | assignment | function_call | value)[0, inf]


-----------------
Basic Combinators
-----------------

Parsers can be combined in series with ``+``:

.. code-block:: python

    name + address + pet

A sequence of parsers is evaluated left to right, each consuming text before the next is evaluated. If at any point in
the sequence a parser fails, the entire sequence fails.

A set of alternatives is built with ``|``:

.. code-block:: python

    name | idnumber | location

Alternatives are considered left to right, with the first successful match being the match for the entire set. Be
careful! This means that for some sets of alternatives, the "obvious" parser may not be the one used, simply because it
came after another match. 

Both sequences and alternatives will flatten like combinators, such that:

.. code-block:: python

    name = firstname + lastname
    salutation = C+ 'Hello' + name + '!'

is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: python

    salutation = C+ 'Hello' + firstname + lastname + '!'

If you need to mantain the logical separation (to parse correctly, or maintain the name of a subparser), wrap the
subparser with ``C``:

.. code-block:: python

    name = C(firstname + lastname)
    salutation = C+ 'Hello' + name + '!'

----------
Repetition
----------

The most flexible option for specifying repetition is brackets:

.. code-block:: python

    keyword[0, 10, ',']

The above would parse ``keyword`` zero to ten times, separated by a comma. The separator is optional - without it, the
result would simply parse ``keyword`` zero to ten times.

We could also specify parsing an exact number of times:

.. code-block:: python

    keyword[10]

Or, with a separator: 

.. code-block:: python

    keyword[10, None, ',']

Infinity - ``math.inf`` - is a valid maximum value. For convenience, it can be imported directly from Comber:

.. code-block:: python

    from comber import inf

    param_list = keyword[0, inf, ',']

There are several convenience combinators for common types of repetition.

For zero or more with a separator, using ``*``:

.. code-block:: python

    parser*','

Or zero or more without a separator, using the unary ``+``:

.. code-block:: python

    +parser

You can declare a parser as *optional* with ``~``:

.. code-block:: python

    ~parser

------------------
Recursive Grammars
------------------

Consider a program in our toy grammar::

    let word = exp(2, 16)
    let maxint = minus(word, 1)

It'd be nice to simplify this by eliminating the variable "word" and pass the exp() call directly to minus(), but to
allow that, we need to extend our grammar to consider a function call to be a value so we can use one as a function
argument. But to do that, we'd need to use ``function_call`` in our definition of ``value`` - but ``function_call`` likewise
needs to reference ``value``.

To solve this issue, we can define one of them as ``defer``.

.. code-block:: python

    from comber import C, rs, inf, defer

    ...

    value = defer()
    function_call = keyword + '(' + value**',' + ')'
    value.fill(keyword | number | function_call)

This way, we can refer to ``value`` wherever we want, and only define its meaning when we're ready. We can safely build
fairly complex grammars this way, but be wary of performance.

-----------------
Controlling Space
-----------------

Before each subparser is run, Comber consumes leading whitespace. By default, this is spaces, tabs, and newlines. You
can change this in two ways: set the ``whitespace`` property on the outermost parser to a string containing the new
whitespace characters, or likewise passing a string as the second argument to the parser. In either case, the value
``None`` will disable the feature altogether.

====================
Building Parse Trees
====================

When you call a parser on a some text, they return a ``State`` object containing the resultant parse tree (``State.tree``).

By default, parsers output a "flat" tree - a list of strings parsed by the "leaf" parsers (i.e. string literals,
``rs``, and ``cs``).

To build a more useful parse tree, you have to provide *emitters*. Our toy grammar contains a simple one that converts
integers in the input to Python ``int`` values:

.. code-block:: Python

   number = rs(r'[0-9]+')@('number', int)

So if we ran our parser on the input "let foo = 5" the resulting state's ``tree`` property would be ``["let", "foo", "=",
5]``. But it'd be more useful if it resulted in some kind of "let" object (that could execute the assignment, or be fed
to a VM, or whatever else). We could define one we can use as a emitter for our let statement like this:

.. code-block:: Python

    class Let:
        def __init__(self, let, variable, eq, value):
            self.variable = variable
            self.value = value
            # We can ignore `let` and `eq` (which will always contain "let" and "=", respectively).

        def __repr__(self):
            return f'Let({self.variable}, {self.value})'

and redefine the assignment rule like:

.. code-block:: Python

    assignment = (C+ 'let' + keyword + '=' + (function_call | value))@Let

Now if rerun the parser on "let foo = 5", we get ``[Let(foo, 5)]``.

As we did with number, you can also combine an emitter with a name, to improve error messages:

.. code-block:: Python

    assignment = (C+ 'let' + keyword + '=' + (function_call | value))@("assignment", Let)

===========
Performance
===========

Under the covers, Comber is essentially a recursive descent parser. It's best suited for relatively shallow grammars
parsing small amounts of text.

You can gain a bit more speed by calling ``analyze()`` on the top-level/outermost parser. This modifies the parser (and
subparsers) in place:

.. code-block:: Python

    grammar.analyze()
    grammar('max(1, 4)')
